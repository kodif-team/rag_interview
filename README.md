# Datasets for building RAG 

1. Use articles_.csv in datasets to build any type of RAG system 
2. Use syntetic questions to **get top 5 contexts** from RAG,  
3. Store contexts alongside question_test.csv file, in columns, like *question, context_1, context_2, context_3, context_4, context_5*, each context should contain only string value
4. Create new branch with your name (Dont try to push main, it's protected by default)
