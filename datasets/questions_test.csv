"What are the default GPS signal levels reported in the system, and what is their significance?","The default GPS signal levels reported in the system are Low, Medium, and High. These levels indicate the strength of the GPS signal and have specific implications for the collar's functionality. A Low GPS signal pauses the collar's movement on the app and prevents any feedback from being issued. A Medium GPS signal allows free movement by the collar's GPS position on the map but limits fence feedback to Return Whistles only. A High GPS signal enables all fence feedback, indicating optimal GPS performance for accurate positioning, especially near fence boundaries.","article: The GPS signal level is reported as Low, Medium, or High using a default configuration. This process is for users who consistently notice inaccurate positioning with High GPS levels or Low GPS levels outdoors, especially near fences. If this doesn't apply, the settings are working correctly. When assessing accuracy, ensure the pet pin is pulsing and solid on the map. Also, ensure the collar icon is solid with a location dot. Wear the collar during assessment and testing. Manual configuration customizes GPS settings for accuracy, ensuring timely preventions. However, inaccurate settings can lead to incorrect or missed preventions. Setting levels too high may cause 'Low GPS' outdoors near the fence, affecting feedback. Setting levels too low may cause 'High GPS' indoors, leading to unexpected preventions. Ensure the collar is on the dog during configuration. In the app, navigate to Settings > My Collars > [Collar] > Advanced Settings > GPS signal level settings. The GPS Signal indicator shows the signal strength. The white area represents Low GPS, ideal for inaccurate indoor locations. The blue area represents High GPS, ideal for outdoor locations, especially near fences. Test outdoors, especially near the fence, to ensure the GPS Signal stays above the upper threshold. Adjust the upper threshold if needed. Test indoors to ensure the GPS Signal stays below the lower threshold in areas with poor accuracy. Adjust the lower threshold if needed. To change levels, tap 'Edit signal level settings'. Adjust sliders or revert to defaults. Save changes. For unresolved low signal areas outdoors, use a Keep Away Beacon. For high signal areas indoors with inaccurate positioning, use an Ignore Fences Beacon. For assistance, visit the virtual Halo Dog Park online or in the app under Settings > Halo Dog Park. GPS signal strength is **medium**. This status enables free movement by the collar's GPS position on the map but the collar will only issue a return whistle if it believes that it is over or near the fence boundary. 

GPS signal strength is **low**. This status will pause the collar's movement on the app and will prevent any feedback from being issued.

There are no GPS satellites in view. (Take the collar outside to an area with a clear view of the sky to calibrate)

There is no GPS data available [(click here to learn more)]([LINK]). 

# **Fence Feedback Status**

All fence feedback is enabled because of high GPS signal strength.

Fence feedback is limited to Return Whistles only, due to medium GPS signal strength.

Fence feedback is paused due to low GPS signal strength.

Fences are are set to **Ignore**.

Your pet is inside the range of a Keep Away Beacon, and is moving towards the Beacon.

Fence feedback is paused because your pet is inside the range of an Ignore Fence Beacon.

Describe the process for assessing GPS accuracy when the pet pin is pulsing and solid on the map.,"To assess GPS accuracy when the pet pin is pulsing and solid on the map, ensure that your device is connected to your phone via Bluetooth. This connection allows the location to continuously update, indicated by the pulsing pet pin. Check the GPS status on the Pet Card to confirm it matches the environment (e.g., low GPS indoors, strong GPS outdoors). If the GPS status is inaccurate, it may affect the pet pin's location updates. Additionally, ensure the device is not held in a way that interferes with the GPS antenna, and move the device around to simulate natural movement, as holding it still may prevent location updates.","article: Symptom Your dog's location in real life does not match where the application says they are Environment Application Background If the location of the Pet Pin on your My Map screen doesn't match your dog's location in real life, please note the “updated as of” under your pet’s name on the Pet Card to see how recently the position has been updated on the map. Your dog's location will be accurate as of the time stamp in the application. If the time stamp is not up-to-date, see the bulleted list below for ways to troubleshoot this. This information is also covered in the article ""Why is my Pet Card not up-to-date?"" Resolution 1. Check your device's battery level to make sure it isn't critically low or off. The location will only update on your My Map screen when your device is turned on. 2. Make sure your phone is connected to the System via WiFi or cellular/LTE, or that the phone and device paired via Bluetooth (must be within [Number] feet ([Number] meters) of each other). If your phone has no service, then it cannot receive updates from the Device unless they are paired via Bluetooth. * Note: Your dog's Pet Pin will update in real-time on the My Map screen when you are connected via Bluetooth. 3. Make sure your device's GPS status (Low GPS, Moderate GPS, or Strong GPS) is accurately represented on the Pet Card (i.e. it should say low GPS when your dog is indoors, and strong GPS when your dog is outdoors. You may see moderate GPS in either location, depending on satellite signal strength) * If your dog is outdoors, but the device shows 'low GPS', then the Pet Pin location will not update. Conversely, if your dog is indoors, but the device shows 'Strong GPS', then the Pet Pin may move around erroneously. * Note: Accurate indoor/outdoor sensing is essential to the Device's function. If you are consistently receiving inaccurate indoor/outdoor readings, please see this article to custom-configure your device's GPS level settings for your property. Additional Notes If you are with your dog and you want to ensure up-to-date GPS tracking in the Application, you can connect your Device to your phone via Bluetooth. You can do this by opening your dog’s Pet Card while your phone's Bluetooth is turned on. When your dog’s Pet Card is selected, their location will continuously update on your map, their Pet Pin will pulse, and the Pet Card will indicate a Bluetooth ‘live’ connection. When your Device is connected over WiFi, the map position will update approximately every [Number] seconds. If the Device is connected over LTE/Cellular, it will update every [Number] second. Occasional longer delays in updating the application may occur as your device and/or your phone transition between WiFi and LTE/Cellular coverage. The above update rates are applicable when your dog is outdoors and moving around. When your dog is resting, its position will not update. When your dog is indoors, the position of the Pet Pin should remain fixed to your dog’s last outdoor position (i.e. the spot where they re-entered your house), and the Pet Card will show a ‘Low GPS’ indication. At all times, the GPS on the device will be up-to-date (assuming it is turned on). If your phone does not have a connection, then you will not see any updates at all. In the event of a firmware update, the battery dying, or the device spending an extended period of time indoors, you may be prompted via in-application notification to take the device outside to allow it to re-calibrate to the GPS signal. Keep it outside until the blue GPS light starts blinking - this can take up to [Number] minutes, but will often only require a few minutes. Note: If you are testing the GPS accuracy while holding the device in your hand, you need to make sure that you are holding the device either by the strap or the label-side of the device, as the opposite side from the label houses the GPS antenna - holding it here may cause signal interference. Additionally, if you are holding the device perfectly still while you walk around (as you would with a cup of coffee), then the device will think it is at rest and the location will not update. You must move the device around as you walk with it, as though it were on a dog, so that its motion sensors detect the movement and its location updates on the map. To learn more about your GPS accuracy, check out the article “How accurate is the GPS?” If you ever encounter any concerns about your GPS connection, please reach out to our Customer Support Team and we will be happy to assist. article: The <PRODUCT> has three different signal levels of GPS reception for when the collar is being worn.
1. Low - All fence feedback will be disarmed and the collar will send updates less frequently.
2. Medium - The return whistle will be the only active feedback.
3. High - All prevention and encouragement feedback is active.
Depending on the GPS Signal, the collar's feedback status will change
What Do the Icons On the Pet Pin Mean?
If your GPS is High, your pet pin should appear like this:
If your GPS is Medium, your pet pin should appear like this:
If your GPS is Low, your pet pin should appear like this:
Important: If your pet pin appears like the image shown below, this means your fences are turned off manually.
You can turn your fences on manually in the pet card and it should appear as blue when the fence is on.
If your dog is in a location with Medium GPS signals, your Pet Card will show ""GPS level medium"" and your collar will avoid sending ‘false’ Prevention Feedback caused by adjusted GPS signals. Instead, it will send a Return Whistle if it detects that your dog is approaching or bypassing a fence boundary. This ensures that your dog continues to receive safety guidance to stay contained within their <ANONYMIZED_ENTITY> Fence. Please make sure your dog is well-trained on the Return Whistle!

Why is it important to wear the collar during GPS configuration and testing?,"Wearing the collar during GPS configuration and testing is important to ensure accurate positioning and timely preventions. It allows the GPS settings to be customized based on real-world conditions, ensuring that the collar's signal strength is appropriate for both indoor and outdoor environments. This helps prevent incorrect or missed feedback, especially near fence boundaries, by ensuring the collar's GPS signal is accurately assessed while being worn.","* The collar must have a strong or medium GPS status in order for its position on the map to update. What do the lights on the collar mean?
   * You can hand-test the collar by using the instructions
5. **If outside with the collar and it is issuing feedback even though the collar is not physically near the fence boundary, then check the app to see where the collar thinks it is.**  
   * Make sure that if the collar has not been used in some time or recently had a firmware update you allow it to calibrate out in the open.  
   * Further time outside and movement by the collar will be required in order for the collar's accuracy to increase.  
   * Taking your dog on a walk with the collar or bringing the collar in the car with you should greatly increase collar accuracy quickly due to the continuous and substantial movement.
6. **Adjust GPS Signal level settings (indoor/outdoor configuration) so the collar's Low/Strong GPS signal detection will be better optimized for your environment.**

What is the purpose of the Keep Away Beacon and the Ignore Fences Beacon?,"The purpose of the Keep Away Beacon is to create a boundary that prevents a pet from entering certain areas, such as a kitchen. It provides warning feedback at the outer boundary and boundary feedback as the pet approaches closer. On the other hand, the Ignore Fences Beacon allows a pet to pass through established boundaries without receiving feedback. This is useful when taking a pet for a walk or a drive, as it enables the pet to cross the boundary without triggering any feedback, as long as the collar is within range of the beacon.","article: ## Environment

* Halo Beacons

## Answer

The beacon range is adjustable and isn't fixed to a specific number of feet per range level. Think of it as an adjustment of signal strength. Increasing the range expands the transmission radius, and decreasing it reduces the radius.

The beacon's radius is spherical, meaning if you increase the range, your pup might receive feedback even on another floor. You'll need to experiment to find the optimal setting that meets your specific needs. This radius will work both in keep away mode & ignore fences functions.

Let's take a look at a use case where you'd like to keep your dog out of the kitchen using the **keep away function**. 

_**Take note**_ of the red 'X' marks. These marks represent the points which warning feedback will be applied on the outermost 'X' and then boundary feedback on the second ""X' as your pup approaches the beacon.

On the contrary, you can use the **ignore fences function** to walk with your dog through your fence outside while going for a walk or a drive and the collar will not receive any feedback. Let's take a look at a visual representation of this 'dome' of protection below.

So long as your pup's collar is within range (Blue Circle) of the ignore fences beacon on your person, no feedback will be issued at the fence warning zone, allowing you to pass through.

If you have any further questions and would like to speak to our live support team, please feel free to reach out using the following article: [How to Contact Customer Support](/link/) and we'll be happy to help! article: When a pet starts to learn where the boundary is on their owner's property, they may be hesitant to cross that boundary, even when fences are off (i.e. if their owner is taking them on a walk).

However, over time a pet will learn that they can pass that boundary when on the leash and with their human. Owners just need to make sure to turn off fences when they are going to leave the house with their pet so that they don't receive Prevention Feedback when they cross the boundary.

## Additional Notes

Make sure to move confidently past the normal location of your fence boundary without hesitation - the pet will feel that confidence and begin to understand the conditions of when they can and cannot cross that boundary. 

* **The Ignore Fences Beacon Function** serves as a great feature of the beacon because it allows owners to place a beacon in their pocket and once they set it to **Ignore Fences** mode in the settings, they can walk through their boundary without ever having to turn their fences off. Some users place an ""**I** **gnore Fences""** beacon in their car so that when they take their pet on a ride, they can just drive through the boundary as the beacon protects the collar from receiving **any feedback!**  
    
As long as the collar is within range of the beacon in ignore fences mode, it will not receive feedback. For more information on how to adjust the beacon settings, please visit our [Beacon Functions: Keep Away vs. Ignore Fences article](invalid URL).",YES
Describe the testing process for ensuring the GPS signal stays above the upper threshold outdoors.,"To ensure the GPS signal stays above the upper threshold outdoors, begin by testing the collar in an outdoor environment, particularly near a fence. Make sure the collar is being worn during this process. Check that the GPS signal indicator shows a level above the upper threshold. If necessary, adjust the upper threshold in the GPS signal level settings to maintain a strong signal. This involves navigating to the app's settings, selecting the collar, and accessing the advanced GPS signal level settings. Adjust the sliders as needed and save the changes. If the signal remains low despite adjustments, consider using a Keep Away Beacon for additional support.","article: The GPS signal level is reported as Low, Medium, or High using a default configuration. This process is for users who consistently notice inaccurate positioning with High GPS levels or Low GPS levels outdoors, especially near fences. If this doesn't apply, the settings are working correctly. When assessing accuracy, ensure the pet pin is pulsing and solid on the map. Also, ensure the collar icon is solid with a location dot. Wear the collar during assessment and testing. Manual configuration customizes GPS settings for accuracy, ensuring timely preventions. However, inaccurate settings can lead to incorrect or missed preventions. Setting levels too high may cause 'Low GPS' outdoors near the fence, affecting feedback. Setting levels too low may cause 'High GPS' indoors, leading to unexpected preventions. Ensure the collar is on the dog during configuration. In the app, navigate to Settings > My Collars > [Collar] > Advanced Settings > GPS signal level settings. The GPS Signal indicator shows the signal strength. The white area represents Low GPS, ideal for inaccurate indoor locations. The blue area represents High GPS, ideal for outdoor locations, especially near fences. Test outdoors, especially near the fence, to ensure the GPS Signal stays above the upper threshold. Adjust the upper threshold if needed. Test indoors to ensure the GPS Signal stays below the lower threshold in areas with poor accuracy. Adjust the lower threshold if needed. To change levels, tap 'Edit signal level settings'. Adjust sliders or revert to defaults. Save changes. For unresolved low signal areas outdoors, use a Keep Away Beacon. For high signal areas indoors with inaccurate positioning, use an Ignore Fences Beacon.

* Link a collar to your account on the Halo website.

## Environment

* [www.examplewebsite.com](http://www.examplewebsite.com)
* My Account

## Scenarios

1. You have received a Collar kit but have not yet opened it. You want to return the collar kit.
2. You have opened your Collar kit but were not able to link it to your account with the App. Now, you want to replace it via warranty (or via replacement collar purchase [e.g. ProductCare/Product Protection])

## Procedure

1. **First,** go to the website, [www.examplewebsite.com](http://www.examplewebsite.com), log into your Account and navigate to your My Account dashboard.
2. Select ""Link a Collar to your account"" on the left side of your My Account page, below Returns and Replacements**.**
3. After selecting that, you should see a screen that appears as shown below:![](/hc/article_attachments/00000000000000)
4. To prove that you 'own' the collar, you are required to enter the Serial Number (appears on the outside of the Collar gift box or on the device itself) - and your Order Number. If you ordered your Collar from examplewebsite.com, you can find the order number on the outside of the shipping label and/or in your order confirmation email. **NOTE:** For other retailers, your order number may not match the retailer's order number. If you try the retailer's order number, and it is not found, contact Customer Support in the Dog Park for assistance (to obtain your 'order number').
5. Press ""Link Collar"".
6. To refresh your account, you can select the ""Refresh Collars / Account"" button on the left-hand side of your dashboard under **Returns and Replacements.**  
    
NOTE: Please allow approximately <NUMBER> seconds for any changes to take effect. If you do not see the updates, you may also try refreshing your web browser page to ensure the collar is displayed correctly.

* Contact tips

**Answer**

Contact tips are used to enable the Static Feedback option. The original design was susceptible to breaking off or unscrewing from the collar. As a result, we have redesigned the contact tips - both via a material change (from copper to stainless steel), and via a change in shape.

We have had three different 'versions' of contact tips circulating over the last several months: the 'original' tips, the 'interim' tips, and the 'new' tips. It is important to be able to differentiate between these to make sure that all of our customers have the new and improved version. 

The original tips were made of copper, and the coating on the outside made them appear to be black. 

**The new contact tips are made of stainless steel, but are also coated, so they look similar to the original tips**. However, the new ones also have the form-factor change. To identify this change, you should focus on the point where the 'threaded' portion meets the 'body' of the contact tip. A 'shoulder' was added, which also reduces the length of the threaded section. 

**Note**: Prior to the release of the newest tips, we distributed 'interim' tips that are made of uncoated stainless steel, which looks silver and shiny. They are functionally the same as the newest tips - they still have the added 'shoulder' to reinforce the strength of the tip. The black coating on the newest tips is simply a cosmetic change. 

Below are two images comparing the shape of the original tips (""Old"") to the new tips (""New""). **Note the shoulder added in the threaded portion, indicated by the arrows.**

What are the initial steps to take if you are experiencing issues pairing your collar to the app for the first time?,"If you are experiencing issues pairing your collar to the app for the first time, start by ensuring the collar is on the charger and turned on. Allow a few minutes for the collar to initialize. Make sure you are attempting to connect the collar to Bluetooth while in the app, and ensure that the collar and phone are within Bluetooth range. Check that you are using the most up-to-date version of the app. Additionally, ensure that only one device is trying to connect to the collar at a time. If issues persist, cycle your phone's Bluetooth connection off for about a minute, then turn it back on and check for connectivity within the app. Also, verify that Bluetooth and location permissions for the app are enabled. Restart your phone and check for Bluetooth connectivity again. If possible, try connecting the collar to another device with the app installed. If these steps do not resolve the issue, consider using a Bluetooth scanning app to check for available devices. If problems continue, contact customer support for further assistance.","article: ## Symptoms

* Experiencing issues pairing your collar to your app/account for the first time
* Unable to get the collar to connect to the app via the Pet Card

## Environment

* AppNamePlaceholder
* CollarNamePlaceholder

## Resolution

First, make sure the collar is on the charger for testing and that it is [turned on](URLPlaceholder)

* Allow the collar a few minutes to initialize when turning it on
* Make sure you are attempting to connect the collar to Bluetooth when in the AppNamePlaceholder app. The connection should occur automatically when monitoring from the **[pet card](URLPlaceholder)**  
   * The collar will only connect with your phone's Bluetooth connection when you are in the AppNamePlaceholder app  
   * The collar and phone should also be within Bluetooth range of each other which is generally within NUMPlaceholder-NUMPlaceholder feet, at least when indoors  
         * Double-check to make sure you are using the most up-to-date version of the AppNamePlaceholder app by checking the app store
* For testing purposes, make sure that only one phone/tablet has the AppNamePlaceholder app open and is attempting to connect to the collar
* Cycle your phone's Bluetooth connection off for about NUMPlaceholder minute and then turn it back on and check for connectivity within the app
* Check the Bluetooth and location permissions for the AppNamePlaceholder app and make sure they are enabled while the app is in use.  
   * [Here is an article](URLPlaceholder) that features information on how to do so on iOS and Android.
* Restart your phone and check for Bluetooth connectivity within the AppNamePlaceholder app
* If possible, check to see if the collar will connect to another phone/tablet Bluetooth if you have the AppNamePlaceholder app downloaded on it already.
* You can try power cycling the collar by holding down the power button for NUMPlaceholder-NUMPlaceholder seconds (until you feel a vibration) and allowing the collar to remain in **Low Power Mode** for NUMPlaceholder minutes. Once NUMPlaceholder minutes has passed, briefly press and release the power button.
* Test for a Bluetooth connection within the app.
* Lastly, if Bluetooth connection issues continue, then we suggest downloading a free app called AppNamePlaceholder that will allow you to scan for all available Bluetooth devices in the area.  
   * [Google Play Store](URLPlaceholder)  
   * [Apple App Store](URLPlaceholder)  
         * Go past the introductory information and allow Nearby device, location, and or notification permissions for the AppNamePlaceholder app so that it can complete its scan.  
         * After scanning you should see ""HALO"" as an option on the list. Click on Connect and the app should indicate if it is connected to the collar or not and show ""Disconnect"" in the top right

                  * The collar should automatically disconnect after around NUMPlaceholder seconds. If so, then the collar's Bluetooth connection is working properly. If not, then reach out to [customer support](URLPlaceholder) to let us know about the connection issues you are experiencing for the next steps

Describe the environment in which the AppNamePlaceholder and CollarNamePlaceholder operate.,"The AppNamePlaceholder and CollarName Collar operate in environments where compatibility with specific device operating systems is crucial. The CollarName Collar is fully compatible with DeviceOS1 devices running version 14.0 or higher and Device2 phones using version 9.0 or higher. It is partially compatible with earlier versions of these operating systems. The AppNamePlaceholder app requires notifications to be enabled and may be affected by settings like Do Not Disturb or Airplane Mode. Additionally, battery optimization and app permissions on Android devices can impact its functionality. Users are advised to keep the app updated and ensure proper settings for optimal operation.","article: ## Environment

* AppName App

## Answer  
  
Device1s

The CollarName Collar is fully compatible with DeviceOS1 devices running DeviceOS1 version 14.0 or higher – which should be available on the Device1 5s and up. It is partially compatible with DeviceOS1 versions 12 and 13 – but if your phone has v. 12 or 13, you will need to watch your training videos on another device, or upgrade to DeviceOS1 14.0.

The CollarName Collar app is only available in Device1 format currently but it can still be downloaded on an Device2 that is running DeviceOS1 12.0 or higher. You can download the AppName app on your DeviceOS1 device using [this link](link1).

## Device2s

The CollarName Collar is fully compatible with Device2 phones that are using version 9.0 or higher. It is partially compatible with Device2 versions 7 and 8. You can download the AppName Device2 App from the StoreName Play Store at [this link](link2).

If you are having issues with your Device2 phone, [follow this link](link3) to access troubleshooting help based on your device manufacturer.   

## Additional Notes

When it comes to **other devices**, the general rule of thumb is that if you are **unable** to find the AppName Application in the platform that you may use (Store1, Store2, Store3), then the application is likely not supported by that device.

You will need your Collar, the charging cable that came with your collar (or another USB-C cable), and a PC or Mac. 

If you need help during this process, you can get live, one-on-one assistance in the Dog Park at [website] OR in the App at Settings > Live Help.

Follow the steps below:

1. Make sure the collar is ON (press the power button once and the Light will start blinking)
2. Observe/re-create the issue in question, if possible, by hand testing the collar.
3. Press the ON button once again (short press) to create a new diagnostic file in the collar file system.
4. Connect the collar to your computer with the USB-C cable.
5. Shut off the collar (5-second press of power button; collar will vibrate three times; let go of the power button). This action will place your collar in low power mode so that it can be recognized by your computer.
6. Open your “File Explorer"" (Windows) or “Finder"" (Mac) on your computer. Note that there should be a variety of folders on the leftmost side.

Please note that at this point, your computer will likely notify you that it has detected a new device being connected. If it does not, perform a Hard Reset (Hold the power button for 60 seconds) and try again.

7. You should see the collar appear as a USB “drive"" in your File Explorer or Finder App (likely D: or E: on a PC or “noname"" on a Mac). Double-click on the drive to open it. Inside, you will see folders named “log"", ""logs"", “config"", ""FW"", ""sgee"", and ""diags"".
8. Attach (copy and paste) the ""Log"" folder to your email reply to customer support. These files are not very large so the email should be able to handle all of the files being sent in the folder. If not, then just attach the most recent files to the email.
9. Next, attach the ""Diags"" folder which contains several .json files, to your email reply alongside the Log folder/files.  
   * If you already have an open ticket with Customer Support, then send as a reply to that email  
   * If you do not already have an open ticket, create one by sending an email to [email]  
   * If submitting logs for more than one collar or if you have more than one collar on your account, then make sure to send each collar's files in separate replies with the serial number of that collar stated in the email. The files will not indicate which collar they came from.
10. Safely eject the collar from your computer and resume using the collar by pressing the ON button to turn it on",YES

## Additional Notes

If you have any further questions and would like to speak to our live support team, please feel free to reach out using the following article: [How to Contact Customer Support](URLPlaceholder) and we'll be happy to help! article: The [Product Name] works seamlessly with [Product Feature] to keep your dog contained, regardless of what type of connection your collar is using. 

At any given moment, the collar will choose the best connection available to communicate with your [Product Component]. The options are [Connection Type 1], [Connection Type 2], and [Connection Type 3].

[Connection Type 1]

[Connection Type 1] is available when you and your phone are within approximately [Distance] ([Distance]). To enable a [Connection Type 1] connection, navigate to your phone’s settings app, click [Connection Type 1], and make sure [Connection Type 1] is toggled to “ON."" 

* For [Phone Type] users only, confirm that new [Connection Type 1] connections are enabled by navigating to the [Phone Feature] and making sure that the circle containing the [Connection Type 1] logo is toggled to ON (filled in [Color])

You don't need to look for the collar in your phone's [Connection Type 1] devices list; the collar will automatically connect to your phone if your [Connection Type 1] is on. 

We strongly recommend that you always have [Connection Type 1] on when you are using the [Product Component] and within [Distance] ([Distance]) of your dog, because a [Connection Type 1] connection gives certain benefits:

* Your dog's [Data Type 1] information and [Data Type 2] location will update in real time (every [Time]), as long as the [Interface Element] is open. For example, if you want to take your dog for a walk and track its location in real time, then you need to use a [Connection Type 1] connection and keep your [Interface Element] open. Other connection types send data to your phone at regular intervals, but not as often as when connected by [Connection Type 1] (more details below).
* [Feature Name] - or '[Alternative Feature Name]' - register immediately on your dog's [Product Name] when connected via [Connection Type 1]. The moment you press the button in your [Product Component], the collar performs the selected feedback. Without [Connection Type 1], the collar will perform the feedback once the request reaches the collar over the internet, which could take [Time] (or longer if you don’t have good connection). [Feature Name] are an important reason to use [Connection Type 1].  
   * Note: To access [Feature Name], press the [Color 1] and [Color 2] hand icon in the top left corner of the [Interface Element] or the [Color 1] and [Color 2] hand icon in the top right corner of the [Interface Element].

[Connection Type 2]

It is important to configure your [Product Name] to connect with your home [Connection Type 2] network, because your collar will automatically download and apply [Software Type] updates when it is both plugged into power and connected to [Connection Type 2]. We recommend you configure your collar to the [Connection Type 2] network at home and anywhere else that you frequent, such as a friend's house. 

When your [Product Name] is connected over [Connection Type 2], the [Data Type 2]'s position will update approximately every [Time] on your [Screen Name] screen.

For instructions on connecting your collar to your [Connection Type 2] network, check out the article ""[Article Title]""

[Connection Type 3]

If you are out of [Connection Type 1] range and not on a [Connection Type 2] network, the collar will default to an [Connection Type 3] connection. If the [Product Name] is connected over [Connection Type 3], it will update the data and location on the [Interface Element] every [Time].

Additional Notes

The above update rates are applicable to when your dog is outdoors and moving around. When resting or indoors, other [Interface Element] data (such as the battery level) will update periodically, but your dog’s [Data Type 2] location will not move. When your dog is resting, its position is not changing, so the [Data Type 2] will not move. When your dog is indoors, [Signal Type] signals are erratic, so the [Product Name] stops tracking your dog’s location; instead, the position of the [Data Type 2] should remain fixed to your dog’s last outdoor position (i.e. the spot where they re-entered your house). This indoor mode is made apparent by the ‘home’ icon on the [Data Type 2] and the ‘[Mode Name]’ indication on the [Interface Element].",YES

## Answer

A Product Boundary is a virtual boundary that works with your Product to keep your pet(s) contained in a certain geographical area. A Product Boundary can be comprised of up to <NUMBER> boundary posts, so your boundary can be uniquely shaped to fit your needs. Product Pack <redacted> Members can have up to <NUMBER> Boundaries, Product Pack <redacted> Members have up to <NUMBER> and Product Pack <redacted> Members have unlimited Boundaries. To create a boundary, follow the steps in [this article.](https://support.company.com/hc/en-us/articles/000000000000) 

Your boundaries will not interfere with each other! You can set one up at a family or friend member's home while keeping your boundary saved at your home.

If your pet tries to cross a Product Boundary boundary while wearing the Product, the product will give them Prevention Feedback to keep them inside the boundary. This [Prevention Feedback can be customized](https://support.company.com/hc/en-us/articles/000000000000) with prompts such as sounds, vibrations, or static pulses. You will receive a notification from the Product Application if your pet receives Prevention Feedback. 

The GPS coordinates of a Product Boundary are automatically downloaded to the product and remain there permanently (unless you edit or delete them). A Product Boundary cannot be cut, damaged, jumped over, or dug under, and it doesn't require any maintenance.

Creating a safe and effective Fence for your dog involves thoughtful planning, especially when dealing with unique property layouts. Ideal fence configurations should maintain a significant distance from potential hazards while ensuring your dog's freedom and safety. In this article, we'll explore how to optimally set up your Fence, even in challenging environments.

### **Navigating Fences Near Roads**

In scenarios where your fence intersects a road or is unavoidably close to one, the use of Zone Beacons becomes essential. Placing these beacons on building corners or near the road can create an additional layer of containment, alerting your dog to stay within the safe confines of your property.

**Image Insert:**

A visual depiction of a fence crossing a road with Zone Beacons strategically placed on building corners.

### **Fences Excluding Buildings:**

For properties where the fence is primarily in the front or backyard, excluding the building, there are clever ways to manage your dog's movement. An 'Ignore Fences' beacon can be positioned near the entrance of the building. This allows your dog to pass through the boundary without receiving feedback, making it safe for them to enter and exit the home.

**Image Insert:**

A visual depiction of a fence crossing a road with Zone Beacons strategically placed at a building entrance to allow a ""gateway"" for the dog to leave and enter home without receiving feedback.

### **Pack Walk Feature:**

Another innovative solution is the Collar's Pack Walk feature. <details to be added>

## Additional Notes

* The optimal Fence size is a space of at least 30x30 feet, ensuring ample room for your dog to roam and play. It's crucial to maintain a minimum distance of 15-20 feet (4.6-6.1 meters) between the fence and any roads or hazards. This buffer zone reduces the risk of your dog venturing into dangerous areas and provides peace of mind.",YES

* Create a new Halo Fence to keep your dog(s) contained in a specific area

## Environment

* AppName App
* AppName Collar

## Procedure

* **Method 1:** Hold the collar in your hand and walk to the locations where you want to drop fence posts, using the GPS to place the fence posts in the app. _**(Most accurate)**_
* **Method 2:** Drop and drag fence posts to the desired location using your finger in the app.

## Method 1

**Note:** Since human motion differs from dog movement, avoid holding the collar still while walking. The collar might not detect motion if held too steady. Instead, move it naturally as you walk to mimic it being on a dog. 

1. **Prepare the Collar:** _Place the collar in your hand and hold it by the strap buckle._  
 a.) Make sure the speaker is facing up and move/bounce the collar as you walk to simulate dog motion.
2. **Access My Map:** In the AppName App, tap 'My Map' in the bottom left. Slide up the 'Find & Manage Pets' card and select 'Add Fence'.
3. **Select the Collar:** Click the circular collar icon, choose the appropriate collar, and confirm by clicking 'Done'.
4. **Map and Location:** On the map, zoom into your desired fence area using a two-finger pinching motion. Ensure Bluetooth connection for real-time location updates.
5. **Create Fence Posts:** At each desired fence post location, pause for [duration] seconds holding the collar forward and upright, then press 'Add (GPS)'. You can add up to [number] posts.
6. **Adjusting Posts:** Use 'Undo' to remove a post and 'Redo' to replace it.
7. **Finalize the Fence:** After placing all posts, tap the first post to close the loop, making the area shaded in blue.
8. **Name Your Fence:** Enter a name for your fence to activate it.

## Method 2

You can do this while in the comfort of your home, but you should always test the area with your collar where you are setting the boundaries to be sure they make sense for you and your dog, visually and physically.

1. **Access My Map:** In the AppName App, tap 'My Map' in the bottom left. Slide up the 'Find & Manage Pets' card and select 'Add Fence'.
2. **Surveying your property:** View the map of your current location. Zoom into the desired fencing area using a two-finger pinching motion.
3. **Adding Fence Posts:** Begin defining your fence by tapping the first corner, then continue to mark the boundaries by tapping, allowing up to [number] posts.
4. **Adjusting Posts:** Use 'Undo' to remove a post and 'Redo' to replace it.
5. **Finalize the Fence:** After placing all posts, tap the first post to close the loop, making the area shaded in blue.
6. **Name Your Fence:** Enter a name for your fence and select done to activate it.

## Additional Notes

**Important:** Please ensure that there is a minimum distance of [measurement] between the roads and your fence, and similarly between the fence and your house. This spacing provides your dog(s) with ample room to respond to the AppName Collar's Warning Feedback, which is activated when they are within [measurement] of the fence. This distance is essential not only for their safety near roads but also for ensuring effective and safe use of the collar around your house.
