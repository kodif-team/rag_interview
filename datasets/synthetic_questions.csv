### Related articles article: <h1>Collar Not Connecting to Cellular LTE</h1>The Halo Collar utilizes LTE coverage to update its location on the Map within the Halo App in real-time. To update the collar's location on the Map, it needs to be connected to LTE, WiFi, or Bluetooth. However, even without these connections, the collar will still function to keep your pup within the safe zone by using GPS data.

If your Halo Collar is not connecting to LTE, kindly attempt the following:

1.  It's important to regularly check the firmware of your e-collar. This ensures that it is up-to-date and functioning optimally. You can find instructions on how to review and update the firmware [in this article](https://support.halocollar.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057563873-How-to-Check-What-Firmware-Version-Is-Running-on-My-Halo-Collar).
2.  Ensure that your e-collar successfully transitions from Wi-Fi to LTE whenever you walk outside and leave the Wi-Fi range. This transition is essential to maintaining a seamless connection. Unplugging the router is preferred for this step. 
3.  Check the collar diagnostics in your **Collar Settings** and view the LTE module specifically. If you receive a message stating that the LTE module is not working properly, please contact our [customer support team](https://support.halocollar.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043976694-How-to-Contact-Customer-Support).

**Test on an Alternate Device**: If possible, try using the collar's LTE functionality on an alternate device, such as a tablet with cellular capabilities or a friend or family member's phone. This can help determine if the issue is specific to your current device or the collar.

**Please Note:** If you have a Halo 3, your collar can connect to any available cellular carrier and will automatically connect to the strongest LTE connection in your area. If you have a Halo 2+ or older, your collar will only be able to connect to an AT&T connection.

In addition, we'd like to share some additional resources about LTE coverage:

If you need further assistance, our team is dedicated to resolving this matter for you.

It uses the latest geolocation technology and is more accurate than your smart phone. Halo Fences are not created using a wire, so they can't be cut, damaged, and don't need to be installed underground. In addition, Halo Fence posts can be placed anywhere, and are not limited by geography or other obstacles that prevent the installation of a wire.

*   [Does the Halo Collar Require Me To Have Cellular Service? article: <h1>Why Is Halo Better Than Wired Fences?</h1>For anyone considering purchasing a Halo Collar or an electric fence to keep their dog safe, here are some reasons to consider why Halo is the superior option:

**More secure**

The Halo Collar offers multiple levels of feedback to prevent your dog from leaving its safe area. These levels include a warning when the dog is approaching the Halo Fence boundary, another level of boundary feedback if the dog ignores the warning, and a third level of emergency feedback if the dog crosses the fence and continues to move away from its safe area. For more info, see the article [""When does the collar give prevention feedback?""](https://support.halocollar.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061320413)

With Halo, the owner gets an alert as soon as their pup receives Prevention Feedback. If your dog crosses the fence boundary, the collar then offers continuous Emergency Feedback while your dog continues to move away from boundary - and once your dog stops moving or starts to head back to their safe area, the Prevention Feedback stops and an encouraging Return Whistle is provided to guide your pup home.

This is a much more comprehensive system for keeping the dog inside the fence than a wired fence, which is one boundary and only offers a singular shock as a deterrent to the dog. Additionally, if your dog leaves the safe area, a wired fence offers no ability to track them, while Halo allows you to monitor their location in real time.

A wired fence also may shock the dog when they try to re-enter the fenced area after leaving, while the Halo Collar will not provide Prevention Feedback to a dog who is returning to safety.

Wired fences are also less reliable in that they don't work if the power is out or the wire gets cut or damaged.

**More convenient**

[Creating a Halo Fence](https://support.halocollar.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042921594) doesn't require you to dig up your yard the way wired fences do. Setting up a wired fence is an intrusive process that can cost you thousands of dollars.

Halo Fences can be set up virtually anywhere - so your pup can be safe, secure, and free to roam wherever you take them!

The Halo App also offers location monitoring and activity tracking, so you can always see what your pup is up to, even when they are out of sight. 

**More personalized**

The Halo Collar offers customized feedback settings, so you can [choose the right feedback types](https://support.halocollar.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044465574) and intensities to fit your dog's personality! You get to choose from a variety of sounds, vibration patterns, and static levels to administer when your dog is approaching or crossing a boundary. See what works best for you and your dog, and you can always be confident that they are safe.

**More humane**

In [the Halo Training process](https://support.halocollar.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044744233), using Cesar Millan's world-renowned dog psychology and techniques, you and your dog will learn how to effectively use the Halo Collar together - all in a way that makes sense to your pup. Our methods are designed to work with your dog's instincts, unlike today's wired fence alternatives. 

Wired fences traditionally utilize only two days of training, so the dog never truly learns the boundary without continuous use of shock. On the other hand, the Halo Collar's training process makes sure that your dog has a sound understanding of what the boundary is, and how to properly respond to warning feedback by heading back to safety - without ever needing emergency feedback!

### Related articles article: <h1>Can Halo Be Used Along With Another Training Collar?</h1>The Halo Collar was designed for the greatest comfort as a standalone safety solution for dogs. It has not been tested for comfort with other collars, _so we don't recommend using it with another collar device at this time_, as this may cause confusion for the dog. 

However, using a second collar isn't necessary - the Halo Collar can be used to provide your dog with remote guidance for additional training support. This occurs through the ""instant feedback"" feature, which lets you send prompts from your phone to your dog's Halo over Bluetooth, WiFi, or cellular. You can completely customize your dog's feedback from a range of sounds, vibrations, and optional static.

Soon, you'll also be able to record your own sounds to use as feedback!

While the Halo Collar is meant to be used without another training Collar system, we definitely recommend each dog in your household have their own Halo Collar. We also offer a [multi-Collar discount](https://support.halocollar.com/hc/en-us/articles/6177551132567-How-Does-the-Multi-Dog-Discount-Work) when purchasing and we're [here to help if you have any questions!](https://support.halocollar.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043976694-How-to-Contact-Customer-Support?)

How does the accuracy of Halo fences compare to traditional wired fences?,"article: <h1>Why Is Halo Better Than Wired Fences?</h1>For anyone considering purchasing a Halo Collar or an electric fence to keep their dog safe, here are some reasons to consider why Halo is the superior option:

**More secure**

The Halo Collar offers multiple levels of feedback to prevent your dog from leaving its safe area. These levels include a warning when the dog is approaching the Halo Fence boundary, another level of boundary feedback if the dog ignores the warning, and a third level of emergency feedback if the dog crosses the fence and continues to move away from its safe area. For more info, see the article [""When does the collar give prevention feedback?""](https://support.halocollar.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061320413)

With Halo, the owner gets an alert as soon as their pup receives Prevention Feedback. If your dog crosses the fence boundary, the collar then offers continuous Emergency Feedback while your dog continues to move away from boundary - and once your dog stops moving or starts to head back to their safe area, the Prevention Feedback stops and an encouraging Return Whistle is provided to guide your pup home.

This is a much more comprehensive system for keeping the dog inside the fence than a wired fence, which is one boundary and only offers a singular shock as a deterrent to the dog. Additionally, if your dog leaves the safe area, a wired fence offers no ability to track them, while Halo allows you to monitor their location in real time.

A wired fence also may shock the dog when they try to re-enter the fenced area after leaving, while the Halo Collar will not provide Prevention Feedback to a dog who is returning to safety.

Wired fences are also less reliable in that they don't work if the power is out or the wire gets cut or damaged.

**More convenient**

[Creating a Halo Fence](https://support.halocollar.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042921594) doesn't require you to dig up your yard the way wired fences do. Setting up a wired fence is an intrusive process that can cost you thousands of dollars.

Halo Fences can be set up virtually anywhere - so your pup can be safe, secure, and free to roam wherever you take them!

The Halo App also offers location monitoring and activity tracking, so you can always see what your pup is up to, even when they are out of sight. 

**More personalized**

The Halo Collar offers customized feedback settings, so you can [choose the right feedback types](https://support.halocollar.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044465574) and intensities to fit your dog's personality! You get to choose from a variety of sounds, vibration patterns, and static levels to administer when your dog is approaching or crossing a boundary. See what works best for you and your dog, and you can always be confident that they are safe.

**More humane**

In [the Halo Training process](https://support.halocollar.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044744233), using Cesar Millan's world-renowned dog psychology and techniques, you and your dog will learn how to effectively use the Halo Collar together - all in a way that makes sense to your pup. Our methods are designed to work with your dog's instincts, unlike today's wired fence alternatives. 

Wired fences traditionally utilize only two days of training, so the dog never truly learns the boundary without continuous use of shock. On the other hand, the Halo Collar's training process makes sure that your dog has a sound understanding of what the boundary is, and how to properly respond to warning feedback by heading back to safety - without ever needing emergency feedback!

It uses the latest geolocation technology and is more accurate than your smart phone. Halo Fences are not created using a wire, so they can't be cut, damaged, and don't need to be installed underground. In addition, Halo Fence posts can be placed anywhere, and are not limited by geography or other obstacles that prevent the installation of a wire.

*   [What are Halo Beacons? article: How Do I Use the Halo System to Train My Dog?
=============================================

The Halo solution is as much about training you and your dog as it is about dog containment and safety. The unique Halo training programs, designed by Cesar Millan, are what will ultimately determine the effectiveness of the Halo system. This includes our **Halo User Training** course and our introductory **Halo Pet Training** course. In addition, Cesar Millan’s years of training expertise have defined the functionality of the Halo system in addition to our unique, simple, and proven training programs.  You can find them by clicking on the training icon at the bottom of the screen in the app:

![mceclip0.png](https://support.halocollar.com/hc/article_attachments/360060976453)

We strongly encourage all pet owners to take the Halo User Training course!

When at least one family member completes the Halo User Training, they may begin training each individual dog using the introductory Halo Pet Training program. Training is designed to be fun for you and your dog(s).

You should train one dog at a time.  You may see results quickly as you progress through the Halo Dog Training program. However; keep in mind that it typically takes about 21 days for new behaviors to become lifelong habits, so it is important to reinforce the training as described.

As part of the training, you will be using several methods to correct your dog. Configure each dog’s feedback settings by selecting your dog in the **Training** tab and clicking on **Settings**. 

![mceclip1.png](https://support.halocollar.com/hc/article_attachments/360060053954)

The Halo system provides four primary methods.  For audible and static stimulation, you can also adjust the volume/intensity level.

*   **Tone**: Activates an audible tone. Some tones can only be heard by dogs’ sensitive hearing.  A tone can be used as either an encouragement or feedback, depending on your training needs.
*   **Voice**: Activates a pre-recorded audio clip. A vocal cue can be used as either an encouragement or feedback, depending on your training needs. _User-recorded audio options will be available in the future._ 
*   **Vibration:** Applies tactile vibration instead of stimulation to your dog, in selected vibration patterns. The effectiveness of vibration may vary according to your dog's temperament and experience.
*   **Static feedback:** Applies brief static stimulation at the designated intensity level.  Always begin with the lowest level that initiates a response as described below.

For audible and static stimulation, you can also adjust the volume/intensity level.

Follow these steps to adjust the intensity level:

1.  Use the Halo app to select the desired sound, vibration, or static stimulation. Then, set the intensity to the lowest level ([change the **Intensity Level**](https://support.halocollar.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046141293)).
2.  In the Halo app, press the **Test on Collar** button.
3.  Observe your dog for a reaction, such as a head shake, neck movement, or just a change in expression.

**Vocal response from your dog:** Sometimes dogs will vocalize due to the surprise of the electrical stimulation. If your dog vocalizes more than once, the intensity level is too high.

The intensity level that causes a slight but recognizable reaction is your dog's baseline level for beginning collar training.  Do not repeat this test.

After you begin training, your dog’s performance guides your intensity selection. As your dog advances in training, you may need to change the level depending upon the training results.

### Halo Fences and Halo Beacons

Using the Halo app, you can configure the Halo Collar with one or more fences. The collar also ships with one Halo Beacon.  Halo fences and Halo beacons are managed on-board the Halo Collar, so the Halo Collar will enforce the boundaries using pet-specific feedback—even with no Internet access.

**Halo Fences**: Use the Halo app to create your own outdoor fences that work just like underground wired fences - but with nothing to install. Press the **Find** button on the **MyMap** tab, and then the **Add Fence** button. You can create and name up to 20 fences, each with up to 20 fence posts.  Place each fence post by either walking with one of your collars in-hand or by touching your finger on the map.  Your Halo Fences are downloaded into each of your Halo Collars and are enforced when you enable Fences On mode for your dog(s).  More information on [creating fences is available here."

Describe the process of changing the battery in a Halo Beacon.,"article: <h1>How to Change the Battery of a Halo Beacon</h1>The Halo Training Beacon uses a replaceable CR2025 battery. To replace the battery:

1\. Identify the loop at the top of the beacon - there is a small groove there where you can insert a thin blade such as a screwdriver or a knife.

![Beacon1.png](https://support.halocollar.com/hc/article_attachments/1500008156242)

2\. Make sure the Halo logo is facing down and carefully pry the back casing off of the beacon using your selected tool. 

![Beacon2.png](https://support.halocollar.com/hc/article_attachments/1500008156302)

3\. Once the back casing has been removed and the battery is visible, carefully remove the battery and replace it with a new CR2025 battery.

1.  **A Leading Solution in Pet Safety:** When it comes to the safety and training of your furry friend, the Halo Collar stands out as a leading solution. Its combination of training support, boundary creation, advanced tracking technology, and accessible customer service makes it an unparalleled tool in the realm of pet care.
2.  **The Halo Training Program:** One of the standout features of the Halo Collar is its training program. This isn't just about setting boundaries; it's about strengthening the bond between you and your pet. It's a journey that enhances communication and trust, leading to a more harmonious relationship. The program does also guide you through the process of helping your dog respect and understand boundaries and feedback from the collar.
3.  **Creating Virtual Fences:** The virtual fence feature is a game-changer for dog owners. Imagine creating boundaries for your dog that are respected without the need for physical fences. The Halo Collar does this seamlessly. When your dog approaches a predefined fence line, the collar provides feedback, reminding them of their limits. And if they do cross the line, the collar encourages them to return, ensuring their safety.
4.  **Advanced GPS Technology:** Keeping track of your dog is made effortless with the Halo Collar's GPS technology. Whether your dog is exploring your backyard or has embarked on an unexpected adventure, you can monitor their location in real-time. The collar's integration with LTE, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth technologies ensures you're always connected, offering peace of mind through the Halo app's live tracking feature.
5.  **Accessible Customer Support:** Understanding that questions and concerns can arise at any moment, the Halo Collar offers 1 on 1 customer support through video chats directly via the app. This immediate access to help ensures that any issues can be addressed promptly and effectively, adding an extra layer of support for you and your dog.

How can users access information about Feedback Responsiveness Scores according to the provided context?,"article: <h1>What are Feedback Responsiveness Scores?</h1>Feedback Responsiveness scores are a useful tool for you to see how effectively your dog responds to Warning Feedback. They range from 1 to 100, with 100 representing the best score.

It's important to note that these statistics are derived from collated data, providing a comprehensive overview of your pet's safety habits. By analyzing these metrics, you can identify patterns, address potential safety concerns, and make informed decisions to enhance your pet's well-being and security.

This score is not a percentage success rate, but rather a percentile of success relative to other dogs with Halo collars. 

**What do these scores mean?**

**What might be causing a low score?**

If your dog is consistently ignoring Warning Feedback and triggering Boundary and Emergency Feedback, then that may indicate one of two issues:

1.  Your dog does not feel or notice when their Halo gives them Warning Feedback; or
2.  They notice the Warning Feedback, but do not know how to properly respond to it

**If your dog is not noticing the Warning Feedback, then you need to make sure that:**

**If your dog is noticing the Warning Feedback, but does not know how to properly respond:**

Answer
------

We're thrilled to present the Remote Beacon, an innovative device that significantly enhances the way you interact with your dog. Designed like a keychain FOB, the Remote Beacon allows you to send specific feedback to your dog with just a simple click. Its design is not just smart but also convenient - easily attach it to your keychain or your dog’s leash for accessibility at all times.

![](https://support.halocollar.com/hc/article_attachments/19847092556823)

The Remote Beacon offers a swift alternative to using your phone to access the Halo Collar app. In situations where time is of the essence, like during walks or emergencies, the Remote Beacon stands out by providing immediate communication with your dog. No more scrambling to unlock your phone and navigate through an app; with the Remote Beacon, a single click is all it takes to guide your pet effectively.

Describe the process to find more details about Feedback Responsiveness Scores based on the context.,"article: <h1>What are Feedback Responsiveness Scores?</h1>Feedback Responsiveness scores are a useful tool for you to see how effectively your dog responds to Warning Feedback. They range from 1 to 100, with 100 representing the best score.

It's important to note that these statistics are derived from collated data, providing a comprehensive overview of your pet's safety habits. By analyzing these metrics, you can identify patterns, address potential safety concerns, and make informed decisions to enhance your pet's well-being and security.

This score is not a percentage success rate, but rather a percentile of success relative to other dogs with Halo collars. 

**What do these scores mean?**

**What might be causing a low score?**

If your dog is consistently ignoring Warning Feedback and triggering Boundary and Emergency Feedback, then that may indicate one of two issues:

1.  Your dog does not feel or notice when their Halo gives them Warning Feedback; or
2.  They notice the Warning Feedback, but do not know how to properly respond to it
