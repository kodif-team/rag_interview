"Hello, I bought a halo less than 2 months ago and the prongs keep falling off, ive gone through 3 now, also my dog was getting warning feedback from inside my house","The prongs on your Halo collar might be falling off because both contact tips must be securely installed and make contact with the skin for the static feedback to work. Please ensure they are properly attached. As for your dog receiving warning feedback inside the house, this can happen if the collar picks up stronger satellite signals indoors, causing it to transition into medium or high GPS mode. To prevent this, you should turn fences off when your dog is inside the house. Make sure to turn them back on before letting your dog out again. For more detailed steps, please refer to this article: My Dog Receives Prevention Feedback While Inside the House and/or Fence Boundary.

Collars location is inaccurate causing the collar to activate as if the collar is approaching the boundary set but in reality is not near the boundary,"The Halo Collar might be inaccurately detecting its location and activating as if it is near the boundary due to several factors. Ensure that your collar's firmware and the app are up-to-date. Also, make sure the perimeter of your Halo Fence is at least 15 feet (4.6 meters) away from your house. Check the collar's current position on the map and adjust the GPS signal level settings (indoor/outdoor configuration) to better optimize for your environment. If your dog is inside, turning fences off can prevent erroneous corrections. For more detailed steps, you can refer to the provided links in the articles.

My dogs collar thinks me dog is at the neighbors house when he is inside my house,"Your dog's Halo Collar may indicate that your dog is at the neighbor's house while he is actually inside your house due to the collar transitioning into medium or high GPS mode when it picks up stronger satellite signals, which can happen around windows, upstairs, near exterior walls/doors, and in garages. This can cause the collar to provide inaccurate positioning. To fix this, you can turn fences off when your dog is in the house to prevent erroneous corrections, ensure your collar's firmware and the app are up-to-date, ensure the perimeter of your Halo Fence is at least 15 feet away from your house, utilize beacons set to Ignore Fences mode, and adjust the GPS signal level settings.

Hello. My dogs collar continues to loosen.,"It seems like the collar might still not be fitting correctly despite your efforts. Here are some additional steps to ensure a proper fit:

Preparation: Make sure your dog is calm before fitting the collar. This helps create a positive experience and ensures the collar is put on safely and comfortably.

Initial Fitting: Position the collar around the middle of your dog's neck with the power button aligned with your dog's ear. Ensure the Contact Tips are not placed over the middle of the throat to avoid pressure on the trachea. Tighten the strap so it fits snugly but still allows room for two fingers.

Tailoring Your Collar: After fitting the collar, gently remove it and commend your dog. If the excess strap measures more than 2-3 inches, trim off the surplus, leaving 2-3 inches for future adjustments. Use the provided clamp to affix the new end cap.

If you continue to experience issues, please refer to our detailed step-by-step instructions and instructional video provided. For further assistance, you can also reach out to our live support team using the following article: How to Contact Customer Support.

Collar gives feedback too late,"The Halo Collar is designed to give feedback at specific times to help keep your dog safe within its designated area. Here are the different types of feedback and when they occur:

Warning Feedback: This occurs when your dog is inside the fence, enters the warning area (7-10 feet from the fence), and is actively moving toward the boundary. This is the first line of defense.

Boundary Feedback: If your dog continues to approach the boundary after receiving Warning Feedback, it will receive Boundary Feedback. If the prompts for Warning and Boundary Feedback are different (e.g., beep for Warning and vibration for Boundary), your dog will receive both corrections simultaneously.

Emergency Feedback: If your dog moves past the fence boundary, it will trigger Emergency Feedback. This feedback continues as long as your dog is moving away from the boundary. When your dog stops moving or starts heading back home, Emergency Feedback stops and Encouragement Feedback begins to guide your dog back to safety.

Please ensure that your collar has a high GPS connection when outdoors to function correctly. If the collar is indoors or has a low GPS connection, it will not administer preventative feedback.

My collar gps is not accurate,"To fix the inaccurate GPS on your Halo collar, you can try reinitializing the GPS. Here are the steps to do so:

Take your collar outside to an area with an unobstructed view of the sky.
Keep the collar outside until the GPS light starts to blink Blue, signaling an accurate GPS calibration. This process can take a minute or two but may take longer in some scenarios.
Once the Blue GPS light starts to flash, your collar has begun to collect ephemeris data and is ready for use. Further time outdoors and continued movement will further improve GPS accuracy.
If you still notice inaccuracies after initializing, ensure the collar is on the latest firmware, check the GPS level on your Pet Card, and view the GPS module in your Collar Settings. If the GPS module is not working properly, please contact our customer support team for further assistance.

Halo Collars can issue incorrect feedback if the GPS signal is weak or if there is some drifting of the collar's GPS position when indoors. Please ensure that your collar's firmware and the app are up-to-date. Additionally, check the collar's current position on the map via the app to see where it thinks it is.

Fence feedback turned off,"The Halo Collar utilizes LTE coverage to update its location on the Map within the Halo App in real-time. To update the collar's location on the Map, it needs to be connected to LTE, WiFi, or Bluetooth. However, even without these connections, the collar will still function to keep your pup within the safe zone by using GPS data.

If your Halo Collar is not connecting to LTE, kindly attempt the following:

It's important to regularly check the firmware of your e-collar. This ensures that it is up-to-date and functioning optimally. You can find instructions on how to review and update the firmware in this article.
Ensure that your e-collar successfully transitions from Wi-Fi to LTE whenever you walk outside and leave the Wi-Fi range. This transition is essential to maintaining a seamless connection. Unplugging the router is preferred for this step.
Check the collar diagnostics in your Collar Settings and view the LTE module specifically. If you receive a message stating that the LTE module is not working properly, please contact our customer support team.
Test on an Alternate Device: If possible, try using the collar's LTE functionality on an alternate device, such as a tablet with cellular capabilities or a friend or family member's phone. This can help determine if the issue is specific to your current device or the collar.

Please Note: If you have a Halo 3, your collar can connect to any available cellular carrier and will automatically connect to the strongest LTE connection in your area.

"The collar is not working for my dog. Fearful anxious. Won't go outside. Finding corners of the house to pee. Completely altered her personality. I keep persisting with the encouragement features and have not even been able to turn on my fence. I've tried it for 6 weeks diligently and no positive associations despite treats, praise, and petting as consistent rewards. My whole family wants me to stop using it but I have persisted because it would be such a gift to keep her safely enclosed on our busy front yard road.","I'm sorry to hear that your dog is experiencing fear and anxiety with the Halo Collar. It sounds like you have been diligently trying to use the encouragement features without success. Here are some steps you can take to help your dog adjust:

Revisit the Training Program: Consistency is key. Start training in a controlled, indoor environment to minimize distractions. This helps your dog understand the feedback from the collar, whether auditory or tactile.

Indoor Training:

Prepare the environment by placing your dog in another room while you set up the training area.
Create a focus point using a container with enticing food or scent at a height just below your dogâ€™s neck.
Let your dog explore the room on a leash and use manual feedback through the app when they approach the focus point. Reward them with high-value treats and praise when they respond correctly.
Transitioning Outdoors:

After mastering indoor training, gradually move the exercises outdoors to help your dog adjust to more distractions.
Conduct return whistle training by starting indoors and then moving to the back door while your dog is outside. Use the return whistle combined with a familiar vocal command and reward them when they respond correctly.
Continuous Support and Reevaluation:

If training becomes frustrating, take a break and reassess your strategies. Make necessary adjustments to ensure your dog is comfortable and responsive.
Check for Desensitization and Proper Fit:

Ensure the collar is fitted properly and functioning correctly. Regularly check that the collar is in high GPS mode while outside and correctly positioned.
Try different levels of feedback if your dog becomes desensitized to the current settings.
If you need further assistance, please feel free to reach out to our live support team using the following article: How to Contact Customer Support.",https://support.halocollar.com/hc/en-us/articles/23537740338327-Revisiting-Training
Collar doesn't consistently follow boundary,"The Halo Collar may not consistently follow the set boundary due to several factors. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

Ensure your collar's firmware and the app are up-to-date.

Utilize beacons set to Ignore Fences mode.

Check the collar's current position on the map.

If outside with the collar and it is issuing feedback even though the collar is not physically near the fence boundary, check the app to see where the collar thinks it is.

Adjust GPS Signal level settings (indoor/outdoor configuration) so the collar's Low/Strong GPS signal detection will be better optimized for your environment.

Additionally, when your dog is inside the house, turn fences off to prevent erroneous corrections. Make sure to turn fences back on before letting your dog out again.
