"The collar is not working for my dog. Fearful anxious. Won't go outside. Finding corners of the house to pee. Completely altered her personality. I keep persisting with the encouragement features and have not even been able to turn on my fence.

My whole family wants me to stop using it but I have persisted because it would be such a gift to keep her safely enclosed on our busy front yard road.",https://support.halocollar.com/hc/en-us/articles/23537740338327-Revisiting-Training
