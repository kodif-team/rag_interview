"The GPS signal level is reported as Low, Medium, or High using a default configuration. This process is for users who consistently notice inaccurate positioning with High GPS levels or Low GPS levels outdoors, especially near fences. If this doesn't apply, the settings are working correctly. When assessing accuracy, ensure the pet pin is pulsing and solid on the map. Also, ensure the collar icon is solid with a location dot. Wear the collar during assessment and testing. Manual configuration customizes GPS settings for accuracy, ensuring timely preventions. However, inaccurate settings can lead to incorrect or missed preventions. Setting levels too high may cause 'Low GPS' outdoors near the fence, affecting feedback. Setting levels too low may cause 'High GPS' indoors, leading to unexpected preventions. Ensure the collar is on the dog during configuration. In the app, navigate to Settings > My Collars > [Collar] > Advanced Settings > GPS signal level settings. The GPS Signal indicator shows the signal strength. The white area represents Low GPS, ideal for inaccurate indoor locations. The blue area represents High GPS, ideal for outdoor locations, especially near fences. Test outdoors, especially near the fence, to ensure the GPS Signal stays above the upper threshold. Adjust the upper threshold if needed. Test indoors to ensure the GPS Signal stays below the lower threshold in areas with poor accuracy. Adjust the lower threshold if needed. To change levels, tap 'Edit signal level settings'. Adjust sliders or revert to defaults. Save changes. For unresolved low signal areas outdoors, use a Keep Away Beacon. For high signal areas indoors with inaccurate positioning, use an Ignore Fences Beacon. For assistance, visit the virtual Halo Dog Park online or in the app under Settings > Halo Dog Park."

"## Symptoms

* The device shows no LED display lights - even when plugged into a power cord (Battery, Location, Indicator light)
* The device is unresponsive to any commands or charging attempts

## Environment

* Device
* USB-C charger

## Resolution

If your device is not charging, attempt to charge the device using another USB-C cable and try different outlets. Make sure that the same power source + cord is capable of charging other devices 

If you have tried this, it may be best to perform a **full power cycle** on the device.

#### **Full Power-Cycle (""Hard Reset"") Steps**

1. Plug the device in with the charging port facing upward, and leave it plugged in throughout this process
2. Let the device charge for at least 15 minutes - even though no lights appear on the device
3. Hold down the power button for 60 seconds and release it. The device may vibrate 3 times and the battery light may flash red briefly, but keep the power button held down for the full 60 seconds.
4. Wait 15-20 seconds.
5. The device should cycle itself back on. The battery light should turn solid green briefly and return to flashing green. The Indicator LED should flash briefly when it turns on.
6. Remove the device from the charger.

If this does not work, then contact support for assistance.

## Cause

* Make sure not to charge the device when the charging port may be wet - this can cause device functionality issues. Article: [(Can I charge the device when it is wet?)](link_removed)

"## Symptoms

* Experiencing issues pairing your collar to your app/account for the first time
* Unable to get the collar to connect to the app via the Pet Card

## Environment

* AppNamePlaceholder
* CollarNamePlaceholder

## Resolution

First, make sure the collar is on the charger for testing and that it is [turned on](URLPlaceholder)

* Allow the collar a few minutes to initialize when turning it on
* Make sure you are attempting to connect the collar to Bluetooth when in the AppNamePlaceholder app. The connection should occur automatically when monitoring from the **[pet card](URLPlaceholder)**  
   * The collar will only connect with your phone's Bluetooth connection when you are in the AppNamePlaceholder app  
   * The collar and phone should also be within Bluetooth range of each other which is generally within NUMPlaceholder-NUMPlaceholder feet, at least when indoors  
         * Double-check to make sure you are using the most up-to-date version of the AppNamePlaceholder app by checking the app store
* For testing purposes, make sure that only one phone/tablet has the AppNamePlaceholder app open and is attempting to connect to the collar
* Cycle your phone's Bluetooth connection off for about NUMPlaceholder minute and then turn it back on and check for connectivity within the app
* Check the Bluetooth and location permissions for the AppNamePlaceholder app and make sure they are enabled while the app is in use.  
   * [Here is an article](URLPlaceholder) that features information on how to do so on iOS and Android.
* Restart your phone and check for Bluetooth connectivity within the AppNamePlaceholder app
* If possible, check to see if the collar will connect to another phone/tablet Bluetooth if you have the AppNamePlaceholder app downloaded on it already.
* You can try power cycling the collar by holding down the power button for NUMPlaceholder-NUMPlaceholder seconds (until you feel a vibration) and allowing the collar to remain in **Low Power Mode** for NUMPlaceholder minutes. Once NUMPlaceholder minutes has passed, briefly press and release the power button.
* Test for a Bluetooth connection within the app.
* Lastly, if Bluetooth connection issues continue, then we suggest downloading a free app called AppNamePlaceholder that will allow you to scan for all available Bluetooth devices in the area.  
   * [Google Play Store](URLPlaceholder)  
   * [Apple App Store](URLPlaceholder)  
         * Go past the introductory information and allow Nearby device, location, and or notification permissions for the AppNamePlaceholder app so that it can complete its scan.  
         * After scanning you should see ""HALO"" as an option on the list. Click on Connect and the app should indicate if it is connected to the collar or not and show ""Disconnect"" in the top right  
                  * Android  
                              * * ![ImagePlaceholder](ImagePlaceholder) ![ImagePlaceholder](ImagePlaceholder)  
                                                               * iOS (requires iOS NUMPlaceholder or higher)  
                                                                                    * ![ImagePlaceholder](ImagePlaceholder)![ImagePlaceholder](ImagePlaceholder)  
                  * The collar should automatically disconnect after around NUMPlaceholder seconds. If so, then the collar's Bluetooth connection is working properly. If not, then reach out to [customer support](URLPlaceholder) to let us know about the connection issues you are experiencing for the next steps

**Note:** Going in and out of the app quickly may cause some temporary connectivity issues between the app and the collar but it should fix itself within a few minutes

"The 'My Location Markers' feature allows you to add a Location Marker to your account, name it, and set a custom radius which applies to that Location Marker only. Previously, your pup's Device would respond to all Device Location Markers it would encounter. For existing users: If your pup's Device is currently configured to respond to all Device Location Markers, it will continue to do so until you add a Location Marker to your account in the App. Once you add a Location Marker to your account, your Device will only respond to Location Markers that are registered to your account. For new users: Your pup's Device will only respond to Location Markers that are registered to your account in the App. If you have not added any Location Markers to your account, you won't be able to turn Location Markers on for your pet. My Location Markers give you more freedom to determine where your dog can go! For example, if you're using a Location Marker specifically for training, then you might choose to keep that Location Marker's radius small so that your dog only receives feedback when they are close to the Location Marker. Alternatively, if you are using a different Location Marker to keep your dog out of an entire room, then you might set that Location Marker to a higher radius so that your dog receives feedback at the doorway or throughout the room. Similar to App Fences, you can add a Location Marker to your account by navigating to Settings and then Location Markers in the App. (For more detailed instructions, read 'How to add a Location Marker to your account'.) To add a Location Marker, make sure it is powered on and near your phone, and then press the Add Location Marker button. Your phone will scan for nearby Device Location Markers and show you their serial #s, which are also printed on each Device Location Marker. Select the Location Marker to add, and give it a name (i.e. “Location Name”). Configure that Location Marker’s range to your desired area. Decide if you want to receive Notifications when your pup’s Device responds to that Location Marker. Once you have added your Device Location Markers to your account, you can ‘mute’ any one of them, and your dogs’ Devices will ignore them. As a reminder, each dog needs Location Markers to be enabled (on its Pet Card) for its Device to provide feedback for any of your Location Markers. When viewing the list of My Location Markers, you will now be able to see: Whether your Location Markers are on (they will have recently reported), and How much battery life you have remaining for each one. You will also receive low battery warnings for your Location Markers. The Location Marker radius is spherical, not flat, which means that if you set your Location Marker's radius to a high setting, it is possible for your dog to trigger Location Marker Feedback when they are on another floor in your house. Keep this in mind when setting your radius. For more general information on Device Location Markers, see the article 'What are Device Location Markers?'."
"**NOTICE:** To prevent corrosion, make sure to thoroughly dry the USB-C port on the [redacted]—and the area around the port—before plugging in the charging cord. Unplug the charging cable before you fasten the [redacted] to your dog. 

# Objective

* Demonstrate how to properly charge your [redacted]

# Background

It is important to fully charge the battery prior to the first use of your [redacted]. Keep in mind that it takes about [redacted] hours to fully charge a fully depleted battery. The [redacted] will only charge while within the temperature range of [redacted]° to [redacted]°F ([redacted]° to [redacted]°C). We recommend charging the [redacted] near a window to ensure that has a clear view of the sky to update properly. 

We highly recommend using a USB-C ported Block and a USB-C to USB-C cable.

"Determine if your home WiFi network offers a 2.4 GHz connection, which is the connection type required to connect to the [Product Name].

Use your smartphone to check this.

If you'd like to confirm that you have 2.4 GHz WiFi coverage in your home, the easiest way to check this is by using the [App Name 1] (for [OS 1] users) or the [App Name 2] (for [OS 2] users). Please follow the instructions below.

**For [OS 1] users ([OS 2] instructions below):**

1. Install [App Name 1] from the [App Store 1].
2. Go to your phone's Settings app. Scroll down until you see [App Name 1]. Click on it to access the [App Name 1] app settings.
3. Enable ""Wi-Fi Scanner"". Confirm that the button is toggled on.
4. Open your [App Name 1] app. 
5. Press 'Wi-Fi Scan', and then 'Scan'.
6. See what networks are nearby. Look for your home network, and see if any rows found indicate channels 1, 6, or 11 (these are the 2.4 GHz channels; higher numbered channels indicate 5 GHz WiFi).
7. If you don't see your network on channels 1, 6, or 11, then your router needs to be updated to turn on 2.4 GHz. Get in contact with your Internet Service Provider's support for help with this. 
8. Once you see your home network one channel 1, 6, or 11, you can configure the [Product Name] to connect to that network.
9. Walk around while scanning to see where you do and don't have coverage within that network/channel - and make sure your signal level is high (greater than -80 dBm) in the area where you charge your [Product Name]. 

**For [OS 2] users:**

1. Install [App Name 2] from the [App Store 2].
2. Once you open the [App Name 2] app, you will see a screen that shows the wireless networks within your range. 
3. Make sure you're looking at the **Channel Graph** page and have **2.4 GHz** selected.
4. Now you're viewing all the 2.4 GHz networks in your range. Note the signal strength (the closer it is to zero, the better the signal). 
5. Look for your home WiFi network. If you do not see it on the 2.4 GHz page, then your router needs to be updated to turn on 2.4 GHz. Get in contact with your Internet Service Provider's support for help with this. 
6. Once you see your home network on the 2.4 GHz page, you can configure the [Product Name] to connect to that network.
7. Walk around your house while scanning to see where you do and don't have coverage within that network/channel - and make sure your signal level is high (greater than -80 dBm) in the area where you charge your [Product Name]. "
"Wi-Fi routers broadcast signals either in the [Frequency_1] or [Frequency_2] frequency. A [Frequency_1] connection travels further at a lower speed. A [Frequency_2] frequency provides faster speeds at a shorter range. 

The [Product_name] connects to Wi-Fi networks that run on the [Frequency_1] frequency. Within a [Frequency_1] network, there are a variety of numerically-labeled channels that your Wi-Fi network can communicate on.

For optimal performance, we highly recommend confirming that your network is on channel [Channel_number_1], [Channel_number_2], or [Channel_number_3]. If your network is on any other channel number, it could lead to slow Wi-Fi speeds and interference. 

## How to change your Wi-Fi router's channel

Follow these instructions to change your router to channel [Channel_number_1], [Channel_number_2], or [Channel_number_3]:

1. Open a Web browser ([Browser_1], [Browser_2] or [Browser_3])
2. Type your router’s IP address in to the browser’s address bar.  
   * Most routers have a sticker on them that shows information such as the router’s IP address (shown as Router login details:) and the username and password you need to log in to the router.  
         * The most popular brands of routers usually have a username of [Default_username] and a password of [Default_password].  
         * The IP address always starts with [IP_prefix] followed by four number sequences separated by dots. For example: [IP_address_example]. Your router will have its own unique number.  
         * Different routers may use different terminology to describe the IP address, but the numeric codes will look like the one mentioned above.  
   * If your router does not have such a sticker, check the documentation that came with the router for the information or contact the router manufacturer.
3. Hit **Enter** after you type in the IP address (example: [IP_address_example_2])  
   * Your browser may display a warning screen at this point.  
   * Click **Proceed.**
4. Enter the router’s username  
   * Enter the username and password exactly as they appear. They are case sensitive.  
   * The username and password can usually be found on a sticker on the router.  
         * If you’re having trouble finding the username and password, check the documentation that came with your router or contact the router manufacturer.
5. Open **Wireless Settings.**  
   * The exact name and location of this option may differ for different brands of routers. Many of the most popular brands show **Wireless Settings** under **Advanced Settings.** Consult your router’s manual if you need assistance or ask a tech-savvy friend or family-member to assist.  
   * Depending upon your particular wifi service, you may have a [Frequency_1] and a [Frequency_2] band available.  
         * If you have two bands, you can change the channel on both bands following the instructions below.  
   * If there is an **Auto-Connect** setting, turn it to **OFF** because you are trying to manually set a different wifi channel.  
         * **Auto-Connect** is usually a **Wireless Settings** option.
6. Click **Channels.**
7. Change your wifi channel to [Channel_number_1], [Channel_number_2], or [Channel_number_3]. These are usually the least crowded channels.  
   * If your router is already broadcasting on channel [Channel_number_1], [Channel_number_2], or [Channel_number_3], change the channel to one of the others.
8. Click **Save** or **Apply.**  
   * Once you save your settings, your router may reboot. Be sure to let it restart and reconnect to your [Device_name] device.

**What to do if You Can’t Change the Router Channel Manually**  
Certain router models lack the ability to manually change channels. If you’re having difficulty accessing the channel controls on your router, contact the router manufacturer for assistance. Find the name of the router manufacturer, look for a customer service number and ask them to help you change the wifi channel to [Channel_number_1], [Channel_number_2] or [Channel_number_3]. If it is already on one of those channels, have them switch to another."
"## Symptoms

* Collar is not performing a firmware update wirelessly.

## Environment

* Product_A

## Resolution

There are a few potential reasons why your collar may not automatically download a wireless Product_A update.

Follow these guidelines to ensure that your collar downloads all new updates.

**Note: When your collar is plugged into the charger and the battery light is blinking RED, your collar is downloading an update. Your collar's upgrade is complete once the battery light switches from RED to GREEN.**

1. You need to charge your collar. Your collar being on the charger is one of the pre-conditions necessary for downloading an update. While your collar is charging, the battery light will blink green.

**If your collar does not charge when plugged into the charger:**

1. Plug the collar in with the charging port facing upward. **(Very Important)**
2. Hold the power button for NUM_1~NUM_2 seconds (you should feel a vibration).  
   * **Important: Do not move the collar during this process.**
3. Release the power button after you feel the vibration. The battery light will turn **solid red**. - When the battery LED turns off, the battery is off.
4. Wait for the battery light to appear as a flashing or solid **green.**
5. Push the power button for NUM_3~NUM_4 seconds and then release. The battery light will turn **solid green** when the collar turns on.
6. Remove the collar from the charger.
[7]. If you are still having trouble at this point, please reach out to our Customer Support team in [Link_1](URL_1).

2. If your collar is running on version VER_1 or earlier (indicated by a lower version number), your collar must be connected to Wi-Fi while charging in order to wirelessly download an update. To upgrade your collar, you must either set up a Wi-Fi connection (then charge your collar), or upgrade using our [Wired Upgrade process](URL_2).

3. If your collar is running on version VER_2 or later (indicated by a higher version number), your collar can upgrade while charging and connected to Wi-Fi or LTE. If you do not have Wi-Fi set up and don't have access to LTE connection, then to upgrade you need to either bring your collar to an area with Wi-Fi or LTE service and charge it, or upgrade using our [Wired Upgrade process](URL_2).

4. Some home networks prevent Product_B from upgrading, although the collar works otherwise. This may be an issue in your Wi-Fi router settings. If your collar is connected to Wi-Fi, but does not upgrade when placed on the charger, you can try to take your collar to a new location and connect it to a different Wi-Fi network to see if it upgrades while charging then. 

If these steps did not help you to get your collar updated, please reach out to our Customer Support team in the [Link_2](URL_1).

"## Objective

* Take a short screen recording with the sound of your Halo App activity to send to the Customer Service team for analysis.

## Environment

* iPhone / Android
* App

## Procedure

**What to Record**

1. If you are experiencing GPS issues, please screen record the My Map tab with the Pet Card open as shown below.  
![](/hc/article_attachments/20891033885079)
2. _**While this screen is shown and you are recording your screen**_: Hand-test the collar at your fence line for the recording by following the steps in this article: [How to test the collar's accuracy by hand.](url)

**Steps for iOS (iPhone)**

1. Swipe UP from the very top or bottom _(depending on your phone model_) of your screen to open your device’s Home tray again.
2. Look for the “record” button. This will look like a solid circle inside of a ring - somewhat resembling a target.

   * If you do not see this icon, you may need to add the “screen recording” option to your Home Tray (Instructions here: url and listed below in 1-7)
3. Once you see the “Screen Recording” button included in your Home tray, tap and HOLD it. You will see a new window appear that should say “Screen recording”, “Start Recording”, and “Microphone On/Off”. You may also see a list of apps.
4. Tap the microphone option so it says “**Microphone ON**”, and the icon appears RED. This means your phone will now record your phone screen _and_ the auditory environment around you.  
   * This is very important so that you can tell us what you see/hear/feel while it is happening.
5. If you see a list of apps, tap “Photos”. This means that your recording will be stored in your “Photos”. If you do not see a list of apps, then your recording will be stored in your phone’s “Camera Roll” automatically.
6. When you start the recording, swipe your Home tray back down before proceeding into the App.  
   * To get the Home tray down, you can either tap or swipe down from the top of the screen, or press the home button until you’re back to your phone’s home screen.
7. Now open your App and begin your test.

## Answer

Removing animal odor from a product can be challenging, but the right approach can effectively eliminate the odor. Try not to completely soak the product but instead, wipe or scrub it with a brush or cloth.

1. **Act quickly**: Addressing the odor quickly increases the chance of complete removal.
2. **Wear protective gloves**: Animal spray contains oils that can be difficult to remove, so protect your hands.
3. **Rinse with water**: Thoroughly rinse the product with water to remove loose debris and dilute the spray.
4. **Pre-treat with vinegar or baking soda**: Both are known for odor absorption. Apply directly to the product, rub gently, and let it sit for about 15 minutes.
5. **Wash with a pet-safe detergent**: After pre-treatment, hand-wash the product with pet-safe detergent. Add a cup of baking soda or a quarter cup of vinegar to combat the odor.
6. **Air dry in the sun**: Hang the product outside in direct sunlight for natural odor neutralization and bacteria elimination. Ensure complete dryness before reuse.
7. **Check for residual odor**: If the odor lingers, repeat the steps or use an enzymatic pet odor remover.
8. **Use a commercial odor remover _(optional)_**: If the odor persists, use a pet odor remover safe for the product's material.

**Please Note:** Let the product dry completely before charging.

Animal odor can be persistent, so complete removal might take a few attempts.

"## Objective

* Create a new Halo Fence to keep your dog(s) contained in a specific area

## Environment

* AppName App
* AppName Collar

## Procedure

* **Method 1:** Hold the collar in your hand and walk to the locations where you want to drop fence posts, using the GPS to place the fence posts in the app. _**(Most accurate)**_
* **Method 2:** Drop and drag fence posts to the desired location using your finger in the app.

## Method 1

**Note:** Since human motion differs from dog movement, avoid holding the collar still while walking. The collar might not detect motion if held too steady. Instead, move it naturally as you walk to mimic it being on a dog. 

1. **Prepare the Collar:** _Place the collar in your hand and hold it by the strap buckle._  
 a.) Make sure the speaker is facing up and move/bounce the collar as you walk to simulate dog motion.
2. **Access My Map:** In the AppName App, tap 'My Map' in the bottom left. Slide up the 'Find & Manage Pets' card and select 'Add Fence'.
3. **Select the Collar:** Click the circular collar icon, choose the appropriate collar, and confirm by clicking 'Done'.
4. **Map and Location:** On the map, zoom into your desired fence area using a two-finger pinching motion. Ensure Bluetooth connection for real-time location updates.
5. **Create Fence Posts:** At each desired fence post location, pause for [duration] seconds holding the collar forward and upright, then press 'Add (GPS)'. You can add up to [number] posts.
6. **Adjusting Posts:** Use 'Undo' to remove a post and 'Redo' to replace it.
7. **Finalize the Fence:** After placing all posts, tap the first post to close the loop, making the area shaded in blue.
8. **Name Your Fence:** Enter a name for your fence to activate it.

## Method 2

You can do this while in the comfort of your home, but you should always test the area with your collar where you are setting the boundaries to be sure they make sense for you and your dog, visually and physically.

1. **Access My Map:** In the AppName App, tap 'My Map' in the bottom left. Slide up the 'Find & Manage Pets' card and select 'Add Fence'.
2. **Surveying your property:** View the map of your current location. Zoom into the desired fencing area using a two-finger pinching motion.
3. **Adding Fence Posts:** Begin defining your fence by tapping the first corner, then continue to mark the boundaries by tapping, allowing up to [number] posts.
4. **Adjusting Posts:** Use 'Undo' to remove a post and 'Redo' to replace it.
5. **Finalize the Fence:** After placing all posts, tap the first post to close the loop, making the area shaded in blue.
6. **Name Your Fence:** Enter a name for your fence and select done to activate it.

## Additional Notes

Please review the following graphics for our fence creation recommendations:

![Image description](image1)![Image description](image2)

![Image description](image3)![Image description](image4)

**Important:** Please ensure that there is a minimum distance of [measurement] between the roads and your fence, and similarly between the fence and your house. This spacing provides your dog(s) with ample room to respond to the AppName Collar's Warning Feedback, which is activated when they are within [measurement] of the fence. This distance is essential not only for their safety near roads but also for ensuring effective and safe use of the collar around your house.

If you have any further questions and would like to speak to our live support team, please feel free to reach out using the following article: [How to Contact Customer Support](link1) and we'll be happy to help!

* You cannot create a fence inside of a fence, or any fence that overlaps part of another fence. For more information, look at [this article](link2).
* You can have up to [number] fences stored within the app
* To edit your existing fences, please visit this [article](link3).  
   * **Video on what this will look like on your phone: (Test video only)**

"Note: There is an existing article on starting a Halo Collar subscription.  The objective is to create a Halo Account and start a Pack Membership Plan. This can be done on the Halo Collar website.  After ordering a Halo collar from halocollar.com, select ""Join Now"" on the Order Confirmation screen to access the Account Sign-Up screen. If the collar was purchased from a different retailer or received as a gift, go to the Halo Collar website and select ""My Account -> Sign Up"".  On the Account Sign-Up screen, enter a username and password for the Halo App and Collar(s). Alternatively, use single-sign on via Google, Apple, or Facebook. This process creates your Halo Account. Share these credentials with family members who will also use the Halo Collar(s). After signing up, you will be directed to the Halo Pack Membership Plan sign-up page.  On the Plan sign-up screen, select the number of collars you plan to use. This affects the pricing, with a multi-dog discount for multiple collars. The chosen number determines how many Halo Collars can be added to the account via the Halo App. This quantity can be changed anytime from the My Account screen on the website. A Pack Membership Plan is required to use the collar(s), but you can skip this step and set it up later by clicking ""Skip and take me to My Account"".  Halo offers three Plan Levels: Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Silver includes all Bronze benefits plus additional ones, and Gold includes all Silver benefits plus additional ones. Silver and Gold plans offer a discount on Coverage Plan replacement collars.  More information on Plan Level benefits is available in another article. All active Plans include Halo Protection at no extra cost. Halo Protection allows discounted purchase of a new Halo Collar kit as an upgrade or replacement for any reason. Halo Care can be added to the Plan for an extra fee per collar, providing a greater price reduction on replacement collar kits. The difference in replacement collar cost is visible when toggling Halo Care on/off.  More information on Halo Protection and Halo Care is available in other articles.  After choosing the protection option, select a monthly or annual billing cycle. A longer billing cycle offers a significant discount. The Plan auto-renews at the end of each cycle unless canceled.  After selecting the billing cycle, press ""Checkout"" for an invoice breakdown of the first billing cycle's charges. Review the invoice and select ""Pay Now"" to start the Plan. The Plan becomes Activated after adding the first collar to the account via the Halo App or after 30 days. Immediate updates to the Plan are possible before Activation. After Activation, the Plan is committed for the billing cycle duration. Changes made after Activation may take effect immediately or at the end of the billing cycle. The account will be credited for the time between starting and activating the Plan.  For assistance with account setup, contact customer support. An article explains how to reach customer support."

"**Objective**

* Turn your phone into a WiFi hotspot so you can access the benefits of a WiFi connection without having access to a WiFi network

**Environment**

* Your smartphone settings
* AppName App

**Background**

If you are in an area without WiFi or LTE connection available, you can turn your phone into a mobile wireless Hotspot that allows your collar to connect to the SystemName System. Setting this Hotspot up will allow you to perform actions like changing your collar’s mode, creating/editing fences, or downloading and applying a wireless firmware update. While you can use a hotspot to connect the collar to wifi, it is not necessarily a long-term solution as the hotspot wifi will use your cellular plan data and is not as robust as a traditional home wifi network. 

The collar can connect to cellular, but when indoors the cellular signal is liable to degrade and drop from the collar.

**Procedure**

To activate your **iPhone** as a personal Hotspot **(Android instructions below)**:

1. Go to Settings > Cellular > Personal Hotspot or Settings > Personal Hotspot.
2. Tap the slider next to ‘Allow Others to Join’ so that it turns green.  
   * Take note of the Wi-Fi Password listed below the slider  
   * If using an iPhone 12 or newer, check that ""Maximize Compatibility"" is toggled on so that it is emitting a 2.4ghz Wi-Fi band. Older iPhones only use the 2.4ghz band.  
   * **Please note:** Some cellular plans do not support Hotspots
3. Go into your AppName App. Click **Settings > Collars** and select the collar that you want to connect.
4. Click the **Wi-Fi** menu, then select your Hotspot from the Available Networks (it should appear as the name of your phone, i.e. “[Name]’s iPhone 12”).
5. Enter the password you previously took note of. Your collar should now be connected to your Hotspot.

![Screen_Shot_2021-03-31_at_1.04.11_PM.png](/hc/article_attachments/1500007542002)

If you don’t see the option for Personal Hotspot, contact your carrier to make sure that you can use Personal Hotspot with your plan. 

You can now use your Hotspot to perform actions that require an internet or WiFi connection. 

To activate your **Android phone** as a personal Hotspot:

1. Open the **Settings** app.
2. Tap the **Network & Internet** option.
3. Select **Hotspot & tethering.**
4. Tap on **Wi-Fi hotspot.**
5. This page has options for turning the Hotspot feature on and off. Additionally, you can change the network name, security type, password, and more.  
   * Make sure the band that the hotspot is emitting is a 2.4ghz band
6. Go into your AppName App. Click **Settings > Collars** and select the collar that you want to connect.
7. Click the **Wi-Fi** menu, then select your Hotspot from the Available Networks.
8. Enter your Hotspot password, and click **Connect**.

![Screen_Shot_2021-03-31_at_1.04.59_PM.png](/hc/article_attachments/1500007707641)

You can now use your Hotspot to perform actions that require an internet or WiFi connection.

**Note**: You may need to use two smart devices (phone/tablet) when trying to connect a collar to a mobile hotspot from your phone. One device emits the hotspot signal and another device that has the AppName app open. Connect the collar to the second device's AppName app and go through the wifi setup and look for the hotspot name (SSID). You can connect the second device to the wifi hotspot signal that is being emitted from your main/first device too but it should not be necessary as the collar connects on its own to the wifi and only uses the app to facilitate the initial connection."

* Halo Beacons

## Answer

| **Notice - Halo Collar kits currently ship with one Halo Beacon, which is for indoor use and is not waterproof.** |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### 

### **General Information**

**Halo Beacons** are Bluetooth-enabled devices that communicate with your dog’s Halo Collar to convey the presence of a boundary. Halo currently offers three models of Beacons: Indoor Beacons, Outdoor Beacons, and USB Beacons.   

**Beacons can be purchased on our Accessories Page at:**[ website_url](website_url)

* **Indoor** **Beacons** are optimized for training and setting Keep Away zones indoors. They can be used anywhere that is not exposed to weather conditions.
* **Outdoor Beacons** can be used anywhere.
* **USB Beacons** can be used anywhere that they can be plugged into an outlet.

All of these Beacons have two functions that you can choose from: **Keep Away** and **Ignore Fences**. 

**The Keep Away function** is used to keep your dog from entering unwanted or unsafe areas. Keep Away Beacons trigger alerts that act like any other boundary when your dog comes near them.

**The Ignore Fences function** is used to create a portable ‘Safe’ zone where your pup won’t receive Fence feedback while it is in range - regardless of whether its pet pin is inside or outside of a Halo Fence. 

For more information on these settings, [check out this article. ](article_url)

Each Beacon's settings can be customized, including the function of the Beacon, the Beacon's name, and the size of the radius. Keep in mind that the Beacon radius is spherical, not flat, which means that if you set your Beacon's radius to a high setting, it is possible for your dog to trigger Beacon Feedback when they are on another floor in your house. 

### **My Beacons** 

The **'My Beacons'** feature allows you to [add a Beacon to your account](article_url), name it, and set a custom radius _which applies to that Beacon only_.

Previously, your pup's Halo would respond to _all_ Halo Beacons it would encounter.

* **For existing users:** If your pup's Halo is currently configured to respond to all Halo Beacons, it will continue to do so until you add a Beacon to your account in the Halo App. Once you add a Beacon to your account, your Halo will only respond to Beacons that are registered to your account.
* **For new users:** Your pup's Halo will only respond to Beacons that are registered to your account in the Halo App. If you have not added any Beacons to your account, you won't be able to turn Beacons on for your pet.

### **How should I use My Beacons?**

My Beacons give you more freedom to determine where your dog can go!

For example, if you're using a Beacon specifically for training, then you might choose to keep that Beacon's radius small so that your dog only receives feedback when they are close to the Beacon. 

Alternatively, if you are using a different Beacon to keep your dog out of an entire room, then you might set that Beacon to a higher radius so that your dog receives feedback at the doorway or throughout the room. 

### **Beacon Features**

Once you have added your Halo Beacons to your account, you can ‘mute’ any one of them, and your dogs’ Halos will ignore them. As a reminder, each dog needs Beacons to be enabled for its Halo to provide feedback for any of your Beacons.

When viewing the list of My Beacons, you will now be able to see:

* Whether your Beacons are on (they will have recently reported), and
* How much battery life you have remaining for each one

You will also receive low battery warnings for your Beacons.

"#### **This article applies to users who have the AppName App version <NUMBER> or _later_ on iPhone, or version <NUMBER> or _later_ on Android.**

**If you have an earlier version of the AppName App, [click here](<URL>).**

Within the AppName App, your dog's Pet Card will give you all the information you need to know about their current status and location.

![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)

Below is an explanation of each component of the Pet Card. Click one of the headings below to skip to that section. 

[Pet Status](<URL>)

[Pet Location](<URL>)

[Pet Pin](#<LINK_NAME>)

[Last Updated Time](<URL>)

[Charging Status](#<LINK_NAME>)

[GPS Signal Strength](<URL>)

[Fence Feedback Status](<URL>)

[Network Connection Status ](<URL>)

[Bluetooth Connection Status](<URL>)

# **Pet Status**

The Pet Status represents your dog's real-time location and safety status. Here are the options for your pet's status:

![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)

Your dog is safely inside of one of their AppName Fences, and Fences are ON (i.e. Fence mode is set to **'feedback'**).

![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)

Fences are OFF (i.e. Fence mode is set to **'Ignore'** feedback), and your app has received a status update from your AppName Collar within the last <NUMBER> minutes.

![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)

When you first open your AppName app, your Pet Card will show **'updating..'** and your dog's Pet Pin will appear dimmed:

![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)

This will last until your app receives data from the collar, or <NUMBER> seconds have elapsed.

![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)

If your app still hasn't received data from your collar after <NUMBER> seconds have elapsed, the status will change to **'attempting to connect..'**

To learn more about why your collar and phone are not connected, see the article [<ARTICLE_NAME>](<URL>)

![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)

This status will only appear when you have not yet connected your AppName Collar to your account in the AppName app. [Click here to learn more about connecting your AppName Collar to your app.](<URL>)

![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)

Your dog is outside of their AppName Fence while Fences are ON (i.e. Fence mode is set to 'Feedback'). **NOTE: If you turn Fences ON while your dog is “Unsafe”, feedback will be paused until the next time your dog returns into a AppName Fence.**

**![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)**

Your dog is inside the Warning Area of their Fence and is moving away from the center of the fence, or your dog is inside the Keep Away Beacon range, and is moving toward the Beacon.

# **Pet Location**

In order to know exactly where your dog is, you can check the Pet Card to see if they are currently in range of any of your Fences or Beacons.

![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)

This icon would mean that your pup is inside of your **'<LOCATION_NAME>'** Fence, or just left it.

**![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)**

This would mean that your pup is within the **'<LOCATION_NAME>'** Beacon range, or just left it.

# **Pet Pin**

**![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)**

Your dog’s Pet Pin will appear as a solid color when it is showing an accurate location on My Map. The Pet Pin will be dimmed when your collar's current location is unavailable to your app (when this is the case, the Pet Pin will display your dog's last known location). [Click here to learn more about why your dog's current location might be unavailable if their Pet Pin is dimmed.](<URL>)

When you tap your dog's Pet Pin, it will expand slightly and – if their location is available – a dot will appear below the Pet Pin showing their precise location.

# **Last Updated Time**

![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)

Your dog's AppName Collar is always protecting them in real time. However, the AppName needs to 'send' location information to your app so that you can see what the collar is doing. Location data is sent to your app and will update every <NUMBER> second on all three connection types [(Bluetooth, WiFi, or cellular)](<URL>). Additionally, the connection type in use can help to conserve battery life while keeping you up-to-date. 

The **'Last Updated Time'** indicates how recently your AppName App received a status update from your AppName Collar.

# **Charging Status**

![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)

There are three battery-related statuses you may see on your dog's Pet Card: 

* Charge your collar
* Your collar is charging
* Your collar is fully charged

If any of these statuses are displayed on the Pet Card, your dog's Pet Pin will be dimmed on My Map – indicating that the collar's location is not updating in the app until charging is complete. [Learn more here.](<URL>)

# **GPS Signal Strength**

You can see your collar’s current GPS signal strength (High, Medium, or Low) on the collar itself (by viewing the GPS light indicator), as well as on the Pet Card. The signal strength your collar is receiving impacts the feedback your collar will provide to your dog. The higher the signal strength your collar is receiving, the more accurate your dog’s location will be on My Map.

![](URL)

Generally, your collar should be receiving High signal strength while outdoors and – depending on your home’s construction – Low signal strength while indoors.

* Your collar will only provide Fence Preventions for your pup when GPS signal strength is High. When your collar’s GPS light is blinking Blue, signal strength is High.
* When receiving medium signal strength, your collar will only provide Encouragement Feedback to keep your pup safe; Fence Preventions will be disabled. When your collar’s GPS light is blinking Pink, signal strength is Medium.
* When receiving Low signal strength, all collar feedback will be disabled (not including Beacon Feedback). Low signal strength will be indicated by a GPS light that is not lit up.

If your GPS signal strength is High or Medium while indoors, and your dog’s Pet Pin position is inaccurate, you have a few options:

1. Adjust your signal-level settings from **My Collars > Advanced Settings**. You can do this to ensure that your collar only provides Fence Preventions while your pup is outdoors.
2. Deploy a AppName Beacon as an **Ignore Fences** Beacon in the area of your home with High/Medium signal strength. This will ensure that your pup does not receive any Fence Feedback when they are within range of that Beacon.
3. Manually disable fence feedback when your dog comes indoors (but remember to turn it back on when you let your dog out!)

# **Fence Feedback Status**

**![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)**

All fence feedback is enabled because of high GPS signal strength.

![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)

Fence feedback is limited to Encouragement feedback only, due to medium GPS signal strength.

![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)

Fence feedback is paused due to low GPS signal strength.

![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)

Fences are are set to **Ignore**.

![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)

Fence Feedback is disabled because GPS Initialization is required. Take the collar outside to an area with a clear view of the sky to initialize GPS.

![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)

Your pet is inside the range of a Keep Away Beacon, and is moving towards the Beacon.

![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)

Fence feedback is paused because your pet is inside the range of an Ignore Fence Beacon.

# **Network Connection Status**

Your AppName App will report the network connection type that was most recently used by your AppName Collar:

![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)

This icon means your collar has been connected using Wi-Fi, and the number of blue lines indicates the strength of your signal.

![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)

This icon means your collar has been connected using a Cellular connection, and the number of blue bars indicates the strength of your signal.

![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)

This icon means that there is no Wi-Fi signal on the collar. This could mean that Wi-Fi has not been configured, or is not available.

![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)

This icon means that there is no Cellular signal on the collar. This can indicate that Cellular connection is paused, or the data from the collar is 'outdated', or the collar is 'disconnected', or the data is 'unknown' because was never received from the collar.

# **Bluetooth Connection Status**

Your AppName App can use a Bluetooth connection to receive data from your AppName Collar instead of using an internet connection.

![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)

This icon means that your AppName is using a Bluetooth connection to send data to your AppName App.

![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)

This icon means that Bluetooth is disconnected.

![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)

This icon means that Bluetooth is currently disabled by your phone settings. 

![<IMAGE_NAME>](<URL>)

This icon means that your AppName App is receiving information about your AppName from another smartphone that is connected to the collar via Bluetooth.

* You can view that your Phone's Bluetooth is disabled under Find & Manage Pets.![](<URL>)

"The [Collar Name] is programmed to only give corrections when certain conditions are met. It will only offer a correction if your dog is moving away from safety. So if your dog leaves its safe area, it will be given Emergency Feedback until it stops moving or starts heading back to safety - at which point the collar will offer Encouragement Feedback to lead your dog back to its [Fence Name]. The collar will never correct your dog when your dog is not moving, nor will it correct them when they are heading back to safety.

The [Collar Name] offers multiple layers of protective feedback to keep your dog safely inside of its [Fence Name]. These layers include Warning Feedback, Boundary Feedback, and Emergency Feedback.

At each of these junctures, the feedback your dog receives is fully customizable; options for feedback include various sounds, vibration patterns, and static correction. 

This information is accessible in the [App Name]; when a fence is selected, you will see the Warning Area and Protection Zone, as well as a small question mark in a circle to the right. Clicking on that blue question mark circle (indicated by the red arrow in the image below) will give you a pop-up that explains when these different types of feedback are administered.

To manage your collar's feedback settings, see the article: ""How to issue or manage Prevention and Encouragement Feedback""

Warning Feedback occurs when the following conditions are met: Your dog is inside the fence; it enters the warning area (which begins about [Number] - [Number] [Unit] from the fence); and it is actively moving toward the boundary. This is the first line of defense. 

Like Warning Feedback, the collar offers Boundary Feedback when the dog is still inside the fence, but continues to approach the boundary even after receiving the Warning Feedback. If your Boundary Feedback prompt is different than your Warning feedback prompt (i.e. your Warning Feedback is a beep and your Boundary Feedback is a vibration), then your dog will receive both of these corrections simultaneously. 

If your dog moves past the fence boundary, it will trigger the [Collar Name]'s Emergency Feedback. While still inside of the protection zone (which extends well past your fence boundary), your dog will continue to receive Emergency Feedback as long as it is moving away from the boundary. 

When your dog stops moving or starts heading back home, the Emergency Feedback will stop and Encouragement Feedback will begin to prompt your dog to continue back towards the fence. 

The collar will not give your dog a correction when it approaches and re-enters the fence from the outside. 

Your [Collar Name] uses GPS data to automatically determine if it is indoors or outdoors. The Pet Card in your app will either indicate a 'Low GPS', 'High GPS', or 'Medium GPS' connection.

If the collar determines it is indoors (Low GPS), then it will not administer any preventative feedback. If it has a 'Medium GPS' (Hybrid GPS) connection, that means that it is either indoors but receiving some stronger GPS signals, or it is outdoors but some of the signals are being blocked. In the 'Medium GPS' state, the collar will not offer prevention feedback, but will instead give your dog a Return Whistle if the collar thinks it is passing your [Fence Name] boundary. Use this article to adjust your collar's GPS level settings to work better for your environment. You should get consistent High GPS level readings when the collar is being worn outside in the open and it should mostly show as being in low GPS when it is being worn indoors. Allow medium GPS to be a buffer area that you would rather see the collar go into when inside so the full fence preventions can be administered while outside."
"**Objective**

* Add or remove a collar or a pet profile within the AppName App

**Environment**

* AppName App

Before you begin, be sure that your wireless network is turned on and you are in range of the WiFi signal. If you have not already downloaded the AppName app, please do so in the App Store or Google Play Store. Be sure your phone's Bluetooth is enabled so you can pair the app and collar.

"Symptom Your dog's location in real life does not match where the application says they are Environment Application Background If the location of the Pet Pin on your My Map screen doesn't match your dog's location in real life, please note the “updated as of” under your pet’s name on the Pet Card to see how recently the position has been updated on the map. Your dog's location will be accurate as of the time stamp in the application. If the time stamp is not up-to-date, see the bulleted list below for ways to troubleshoot this. This information is also covered in the article ""Why is my Pet Card not up-to-date?"" Resolution 1. Check your device's battery level to make sure it isn't critically low or off. The location will only update on your My Map screen when your device is turned on. 2. Make sure your phone is connected to the System via WiFi or cellular/LTE, or that the phone and device paired via Bluetooth (must be within [Number] feet ([Number] meters) of each other). If your phone has no service, then it cannot receive updates from the Device unless they are paired via Bluetooth. * Note: Your dog's Pet Pin will update in real-time on the My Map screen when you are connected via Bluetooth. 3. Make sure your device's GPS status (Low GPS, Moderate GPS, or Strong GPS) is accurately represented on the Pet Card (i.e. it should say low GPS when your dog is indoors, and strong GPS when your dog is outdoors. You may see moderate GPS in either location, depending on satellite signal strength) * If your dog is outdoors, but the device shows 'low GPS', then the Pet Pin location will not update. Conversely, if your dog is indoors, but the device shows 'Strong GPS', then the Pet Pin may move around erroneously. * Note: Accurate indoor/outdoor sensing is essential to the Device's function. If you are consistently receiving inaccurate indoor/outdoor readings, please see this article to custom-configure your device's GPS level settings for your property. Additional Notes If you are with your dog and you want to ensure up-to-date GPS tracking in the Application, you can connect your Device to your phone via Bluetooth. You can do this by opening your dog’s Pet Card while your phone's Bluetooth is turned on. When your dog’s Pet Card is selected, their location will continuously update on your map, their Pet Pin will pulse, and the Pet Card will indicate a Bluetooth ‘live’ connection. When your Device is connected over WiFi, the map position will update approximately every [Number] seconds. If the Device is connected over LTE/Cellular, it will update every [Number] second. Occasional longer delays in updating the application may occur as your device and/or your phone transition between WiFi and LTE/Cellular coverage. The above update rates are applicable when your dog is outdoors and moving around. When your dog is resting, its position will not update. When your dog is indoors, the position of the Pet Pin should remain fixed to your dog’s last outdoor position (i.e. the spot where they re-entered your house), and the Pet Card will show a ‘Low GPS’ indication. At all times, the GPS on the device will be up-to-date (assuming it is turned on). If your phone does not have a connection, then you will not see any updates at all. In the event of a firmware update, the battery dying, or the device spending an extended period of time indoors, you may be prompted via in-application notification to take the device outside to allow it to re-calibrate to the GPS signal. Keep it outside until the blue GPS light starts blinking - this can take up to [Number] minutes, but will often only require a few minutes. Note: If you are testing the GPS accuracy while holding the device in your hand, you need to make sure that you are holding the device either by the strap or the label-side of the device, as the opposite side from the label houses the GPS antenna - holding it here may cause signal interference. Additionally, if you are holding the device perfectly still while you walk around (as you would with a cup of coffee), then the device will think it is at rest and the location will not update. You must move the device around as you walk with it, as though it were on a dog, so that its motion sensors detect the movement and its location updates on the map. To learn more about your GPS accuracy, check out the article “How accurate is the GPS?” If you ever encounter any concerns about your GPS connection, please reach out to our Customer Support Team and we will be happy to assist."

"The Halo Collar can be used with dogs that have visual impairments. The Halo System is not dependent on sight-based training like some other systems because dogs primarily use their sense of smell, followed by sight and hearing. Halo works with a dog's natural instincts. The 21-day program teaches users to engage a dog's sense of smell. Users then learn to guide their dog away from boundaries and back for positive reinforcement. The program introduces various smells and training scenarios so the dog associates prompts from the Halo Collar with avoiding danger and returning to safety. Because the Halo Collar's prompts have a universal directional meaning, a dog's blindness is not a barrier to using the system. It's crucial to provide Prevention Feedback at the correct time, especially for dogs with visual impairments. A manual approach to indoor beacon training is recommended, allowing for complete control over feedback timing. The Halo Beacon creates indoor Bluetooth boundaries and is part of the app's training process. For dogs with visual impairments, observing their body language is essential to ensure they are attending to the training scent when a prompt is given. Extra time should be dedicated to this process until the dog consistently understands that the first prompt means to stop and turn back. For additional support, users can contact customer support."

"The canine is not responding or performing the desired action when it receives feedback from the Device. Before you start training, follow the steps below to learn what levels of feedback prompts work best for your canine. It is imperative that you determine your canine’s baseline feedback levels before you begin to train them. Have your canine in a calm, distraction-free room, with the device on your canine, and your canine in a relaxed mood. Pick a sound you think will work for your canine, test it at a low level, and observe your canine closely to see if it triggers a response. Some canines will show an obvious ‘tell’ when they notice the feedback, but for other canines it might be really subtle. It’s important to pay close attention and look for the different responses that your canine gives. At what sound or other stimuli level does your canine first start to hear or feel the feedback? When your canine responds to the feedback, you should not show any outward reaction. If you’re not sure if your canine reacted at all, pick up the level by one, and see if your canine gives a more clear reaction to that. This exercise is simply to find the baseline level that works for your canine. Test for sound first, and once you’ve found the correct baseline level for sound, wait at least 30 minutes before testing other stimuli, so that you have a ‘fresh canine’ when testing the next prompt. Repeat the process for other stimuli type and then wait at least 30 minutes before moving on to testing other stimuli type. When you graduate to scenarios where there are potential distractions, then you will likely need to bump up the feedback level until your canine consistently notices the feedback, even in a distraction-filled area. Repeat exercises as needed. Practice exercises repeatedly until your canine fully understands the expectations. Make sure you've completed the training process in its entirety. The training process is deliberately thorough and repetitive. Temper your expectations. Canines learn differently than us, so just because you understand it doesn’t mean your canine does yet. Stay positive. Canines feed off of the energy that we provide. The Device is a communication device. The communication is intended to motivate your canine to do something and educate them that they did the right thing. Over time, they will learn to associate the prompts with the desired action, but this does not happen overnight. The more you calmly and patiently train your canine to understand these prompts, the more effective they will become over time, until your canine’s response is second-nature. If you are willing to put in the time and effort to help your canine to build these associations, then you will reap the rewards of enhanced freedom and safety for your pup in the long-term."
"The [REDACTED] uses GPS data to automatically determine if it is indoors or outdoors, to ensure that your dog only receives feedback at the appropriate times. This information is accessed on the Pet Card in the [REDACTED]; the GPS Status and Fence Feedback Status will indicate if Fence Feedback is enabled for your dog, depending on the signal it is receiving. When this feature is working properly, you do not need to turn fences off when your dog goes inside.

It is important for your Product's compass to be properly calibrated so that it can correctly identify changes in direction, such as when your dog receives boundary feedback and then turns around to head back to safety. This used to be a manual feature that is no longer in the app.

We are happy to inform that the collar's compass will now calibrate itself during the system reconfiguration that it performs every so often. For this reason, that feature was taken out of the App. The device will be able to detect anytime that the compass is in need of being calibrated.

* Product Name

## Answer

The Product Name is capable of providing six types of feedback:

* Prevention Feedback — **Warning**, **Boundary**, and **Emergency** feedback
* Encouragement Feedback — **Whistle, Good Dog**, and **Come Home** feedback

Each type of feedback has predefined default settings, but you can customize the sounds, vibrations, or even static settings at any time. With a variety of sounds, vibration patterns, and static levels to choose from—including Person's various verbal feedback options and his famous ""TSCH"" sound—you have complete control over your dog's experience. With Person's guidance, you'll be able to set the best feedback for your dog's energy levels.

**Note**: In order for the static to work, you must install the metallic contact tips and both contact tips have to make contact with the skin.

## Environment

* [REDACTED] App

## Resolution

At all times, the GPS on your [REDACTED] Collar is up-to-date (assuming the collar is on). However, there are a few reasons why that information might not be recently updated on your **[REDACTED] Card** in the [REDACTED] App.

First, confirm that your [REDACTED] Collar has power; if the battery on your collar is critically low or it has shut off, then it cannot send updates to your phone.

The other likely reason why your **[REDACTED] Card** data may not be up-to-date is if you are in an area with no cellular or WiFi service.

Your [REDACTED] collar can only provide updates via WiFi, Bluetooth, or LTE cellular. The collar will constantly try to pick the most efficient path to transmit data (if it has any to send) to your phone, and will switch seamlessly between them as needed.

Your phone is only able to receive updates from the [REDACTED] Collar when the two are connected via Bluetooth, _or_ if your phone is connected to the [REDACTED] System via WiFi or your phone's cellular. If you aren't connected via Bluetooth or WiFi, and your phone is out of cellular and WiFi range, then it will be unable to receive updates from the [REDACTED] Collar or the [REDACTED] System.

For more detailed information on how your phone's connection type impacts how often the data on the **[REDACTED] Card** gets updated, please see the article [""Why is there a difference between my dog's location and what I see in the App?""](https://[REDACTED]/[REDACTED]/[REDACTED]/[REDACTED])

"If you are concerned with how frequently your dog barks, we recommend that you seek the help of a reputable trainer to help you diagnose the issue and curb this behavior through positive associations.

While excessive barking can undoubtedly be disturbing, it is an important part of how dogs communicate! There could be an underlying cause explaining why your dog is barking, such as hunger, anxiety, discomfort, or because they need something. 

The training method teaches you that every ""no"" is followed by a positive ""yes"" to reward and encourage the behavior you DO want! So while the Collar can be used to provide training guidance, we recommend that you find someone to help you uncover the root cause of your dog's barking and address that first - rather than using any collar as an anti-bark collar that may prevent your dog from telling you something important."
"## Environment

* Halo Collar

## Answer

Once your dog completes the training, they'll know the meaning of the Fence Feedback notifications and won't leave their Halo Fence boundary. 

In the event that a dog ignores the Feedback, our Halo Fence is not like a 'regular' fence, which doesn't offer any protection once you move beyond it. With Halo, your dog will receive Emergency Feedback when it crosses the fence boundary *while moving away from the safe zone*. This is not a one-off event; the dog will continue to receive Emergency Feedback if it continues to move away from the safe zone. 

As soon as your dog stops moving or turns around and starts heading back to safety, the Emergency Feedback will cease, and the collar will begin to offer Encouragement Feedback (specifically, the configurable Return Whistle) to call them back to their safe zone. 

**Protection Zone**

There is a Protection Zone that extends about [Number] feet ([Number] meters) beyond the boundary of your Halo Fence. *Your dog will continue to receive Emergency Feedback as long as it is continuing to move away from safety and still within the Protection Zone.*

If the dog moves beyond the outer limit of the Protection Zone, the Halo Collar will enter 'Lost Mode'. Once in Lost Mode, the collar will no longer give your dog Emergency Feedback, so as not to confuse your dog further. Instead, it will direct your dog back to the safety of your Halo Fence using the Return Whistle. These encouraging prompts will continue until your dog is safely within the confines of your Halo Fence once again. 

**Note:** You can view your dog's location using the My Map feature of the App. The collar will provide location updates as long as your phone is connected to the Internet and your dog's Halo is connected to the Internet via cellular ([Company Name]), Wi-Fi, or has a Bluetooth connection to your phone. You will be notified via the Halo App when your dog receives its first Emergency Feedback when leaving the Halo Fence.

"## Environment

* Product_A
* App_A

## Answer

If your dog has already been trained on a different fence system, it is highly recommended that you take the Training_Course_A with your Product_A. This is because the feedback provided by previous systems can be completely different than what the Product_A provides. The Product_A has its own unique customizable sounds that may take some getting used to. It's important to practice and make sure your dog understands the new boundaries and feedback.

The ultimate goal of training is to build a strong bond and mutual understanding between you and your dog- while helping your dog develop good habits and behaviors. By using Person_A's methods of training, you can find what works best for you and your dog, and achieve better results in your training.

## Additional Notes

Your dog that has been previously trained to respect the boundaries from your wired or In-Ground Fence may have a better time understanding the training as they may recognize the sensation that they receive and associate it with specific behaviors or commands.

Additionally, the previous training may have instilled a level of obedience or responsiveness in your dog, making it more receptive to new training!

However, it's important to note that each dog is unique and may respond differently to training, regardless of previous experience. It's always important to approach training with patience, consistency, and a focus on positive reinforcement techniques.

Due to the nature of GPS technology, the Product_A's fence containment and tracking functions are intended for outdoor use.

* Contact tips

**Answer**

Contact tips are used to enable the Static Feedback option. The original design was susceptible to breaking off or unscrewing from the collar. As a result, we have redesigned the contact tips - both via a material change (from copper to stainless steel), and via a change in shape.

We have had three different 'versions' of contact tips circulating over the last several months: the 'original' tips, the 'interim' tips, and the 'new' tips. It is important to be able to differentiate between these to make sure that all of our customers have the new and improved version. 

The original tips were made of copper, and the coating on the outside made them appear to be black. 

**The new contact tips are made of stainless steel, but are also coated, so they look similar to the original tips**. However, the new ones also have the form-factor change. To identify this change, you should focus on the point where the 'threaded' portion meets the 'body' of the contact tip. A 'shoulder' was added, which also reduces the length of the threaded section. 

**Note**: Prior to the release of the newest tips, we distributed 'interim' tips that are made of uncoated stainless steel, which looks silver and shiny. They are functionally the same as the newest tips - they still have the added 'shoulder' to reinforce the strength of the tip. The black coating on the newest tips is simply a cosmetic change. 

Below are two images comparing the shape of the original tips (""Old"") to the new tips (""New""). **Note the shoulder added in the threaded portion, indicated by the arrows.**

"## Symptoms

* A pet may not be responding to feedback.
* Boundaries may need to be reinforced with a pet.

## Resolution

**Revisiting the Training Program with Training Collar**

Consistency is key. Training a pet with the Training Collar is best done in a controlled, indoor environment to minimize distractions. This setting helps a pet clearly understand the feedback from the collar, whether auditory or tactile.

During the initial phase, a pet will learn two essential commands:

1. Keep away from boundaries
2. Come back to safety

Set aside about 30 minutes for this exercise. Use **manual feedback** for the following exercises.

**Setting Up Your Training Space**

Prepare the Environment: Place your pet in another room as you prepare the training area.
Create a Focus Point: Use a container to hold enticing food or scent at a height just below your pet’s neck, so they can see but not easily reach the treat.

* Important Note: When setting up your feedback settings, be sure to find the right setting that catches your pet's attention without startling them. It is best to start at a lower setting and work your way up until you find the setting that works best.
* View this article to understand how to [manage your feedback settings.](example.com)

Let your pet into the room on a lead or leash. Allow them to explore without walking them. The scent should draw them towards the food, in which case you would apply your feedback manually through the app.

**Responding to Feedback**

If your pet ignores the collar’s feedback, gently use the leash to guide them back. Reattempt this exercise and be sure that you are rewarding them with a high-value treat and praise when they behave correctly.

**Transitioning Outdoors**

After mastering indoor training, gradually move the exercises outdoors to help your pet adjust to more distractions. This transition is crucial for reinforcing the behaviors learned indoors in a more challenging environment.

Here is a fun exercise that can familiarize your pet with the return whistle!

### **Return Whistle Training**

**Phase 1: Indoor Familiarization**

1) Start inside in a calm, distraction-free area.
2) Go to another room, out of your pet’s sight, and use the manual return whistle from the app. You can layer the whistle with a familiar vocal command.
3) Repeat up to 10 times daily, ensuring at least 15 minutes of training, offering intermittent treats and consistent praise and love when they respond correctly!

**Phase 2: Outdoor Introduction**

1) Conduct this phase by the back door while your pet is outside.
2) Let your pet explore briefly, then apply the return whistle combined with your command.

Continue this for about 15 minutes daily, testing your pet’s response to the training amid outdoor distractions. Of course, reward with love and praise when they return back to you.

**Phase 3: Real-World Testing**

1) Ensure your pet is outside and initially out of sight—viewing from a window or door is ideal.
2) After some time, use the return whistle and observe your pet’s response.
3) Consistently reward with praise, and offer treats periodically when they return back to you.

**Continuous Support and Reevaluation**

Remember, if training becomes frustrating, it’s okay to take a break. Reassess your strategies and make necessary adjustments.

## Cause

**Desensitization**: If the feedback (such as vibration or sound) is used too frequently or inconsistently, the pet might become desensitized to it. This means they get used to the sensation or sound and no longer find it motivating or discouraging. You can try different levels of feedback in this case.

**Improper Fit or Function**: If the collar is not fitted properly, or if it's malfunctioning, the pet might not be receiving the feedback as intended. Regular checks to ensure the collar is in high GPS mode while outside and correctly positioned are crucial.

**Lack of Reinforcement**: Positive reinforcement is essential in pet training. If the feedback from the collar is not paired with positive reinforcement (like treats or praise), the pet may not see the value in responding.

"**Symptom**

* My dog isn't interested in or won't go near the food during training

**Environment**

* Training

**Solution**

During [REDACTED] training, you will be asked to present your dog with intriguing smells to activate their nose. The nose controls 60% of the brain, so this training method will improve your dog's ability to learn effectively. Many dogs will immediately be intrigued as soon as they smell any food; others may require a bit of creativity to get them engaged. If you find that the smell of the high-value food item* you selected is not effective, try any or all of the following options:

1. Try heating up the food, or presenting a wet food (rather than dry kibble). Both hot and/or wet foods will increase the strength of the scent. For example, hot [REDACTED] presents a more stimulating scent than cold [REDACTED].
2. Try presenting a different food that your dog isn’t used to. For example, if your dog has never smelled [REDACTED] food before, this will be a ""new"" smell that will prompt them to investigate and learn. Or, try adding unique condiments to change the scent of a common food (like [REDACTED]), or provide a smell your dog has never encountered before (like a certain type of cuisine).
3. If switching up your food isn't working, try an _even_ _more_ unfamiliar (and strong) scent, like [REDACTED] oil or [REDACTED] oil.
4. Try experimenting with different containers and environments. For example, you can try putting the food in a small trash can instead of [REDACTED], if your dog is trained not to eat human food. Get creative! You can use a variety of household containers, including:  
   * food storage containers with the lid partially open, or held down with a rubber band  
   * a trash can or bucket that's around head-or-neck-high for your dog (so he or she has to peer in without easily retrieving the food)  
   * new or used takeout containers  
   * a bowl covered in hole-filled plastic wrap
5. If your dog has learned not to ""beg"" for food in the kitchen, you may want to consider setting up your training environment in the living room.

These variations should help to engage your dog's sense of smell and curiosity, ultimately leading to a more effective training process. 

**Additional Notes**

*A high-value food item is typically a strong-smelling food, like [REDACTED], [REDACTED], or [REDACTED] that your dog typically responds to with curiosity or interest. It could also be an unusual smell which your dog has never encountered, or encounters rarely."
"For anyone considering purchasing a ProductA or a ProductB to keep their dog safe, here are some reasons to consider why ProductA is the superior option:

**More secure**

ProductA offers multiple levels of feedback to prevent your dog from leaving its safe area. These levels include a warning when the dog is approaching the BoundaryA, another level of boundary feedback if the dog ignores the warning, and a third level of emergency feedback if the dog crosses the fence and continues to move away from its safe area. For more info, see the article [Link1].

With ProductA, the owner gets an alert as soon as their pup receives Prevention Feedback. If your dog crosses the fence boundary, the collar then offers continuous Emergency Feedback while your dog continues to move away from boundary - and once your dog stops moving or starts to head back to their safe area, the Prevention Feedback stops and an encouraging Return Whistle is provided to guide your pup home.

This is a much more comprehensive system for keeping the dog inside the fence than ProductB, which is one boundary and only offers a singular shock as a deterrent to the dog. Additionally, if your dog leaves the safe area, ProductB offers no ability to track them, while ProductA allows you to monitor their location in real time.

ProductB also may shock the dog when they try to re-enter the fenced area after leaving, while ProductA will not provide Prevention Feedback to a dog who is returning to safety.

ProductBs are also less reliable in that they don't work if the power is out or the wire gets cut or damaged.

**More convenient**

[Link2] doesn't require you to dig up your yard the way ProductBs do. Setting up ProductB is an intrusive process that can cost you thousands of dollars.

BoundaryAs can be set up virtually anywhere - so your pup can be safe, secure, and free to roam wherever you take them!

App also offers location monitoring and activity tracking, so you can always see what your pup is up to, even when they are out of sight. 

**More personalized**

ProductA offers customized feedback settings, so you can [Link3] and intensities to fit your dog's personality! You get to choose from a variety of sounds, vibration patterns, and static levels to administer when your dog is approaching or crossing a boundary. See what works best for you and your dog, and you can always be confident that they are safe.

**More humane**

In [Link4], using Person's world-renowned dog psychology and techniques, you and your dog will learn how to effectively use ProductA together - all in a way that makes sense to your pup. Our methods are designed to work with your dog's instincts, unlike today's ProductB alternatives. 

ProductBs traditionally utilize only two days of training, so the dog never truly learns the boundary without continuous use of shock. On the other hand, ProductA's training process makes sure that your dog has a sound understanding of what the boundary is, and how to properly respond to warning feedback by heading back to safety - without ever needing emergency feedback!"

"The ""Device"" uses ephemeris data from GPS satellites to determine location. This data is collected over time to improve accuracy. Re-syncing with satellites is needed in three situations: 1. Unboxing, 2. After updates, 3. Extended power-off periods.  A blinking red ""Indicator Light"" and an app notification signal the need for GPS initialization. To initialize, take the device outside with a clear view of the sky. Keep it outside until the ""Indicator Light"" blinks blue. This can take a few minutes. Moving around with the device can help verify GPS accuracy. Once the ""Indicator Light"" blinks blue, the device is ready. Continued outdoor use improves accuracy. The device receives satellite data when charging and connected to Wi-Fi, reducing the need for frequent initialization. However, occasional initialization might still be required."

**Important**: _Please note that warning feedback and encouragements are an important part of the ProductNamePlaceholder Collar behavior training and we strongly urge that you complete the ProductNamePlaceholder Collar Behavior Training section in the App before attempting to manually send warning feedback or encouragements to your dog. Additionally, as part of the Behavior Training, you will receive instruction to set the warning feedback to the minimum level required to get the appropriate response for your dog. It is important that these settings are utilized in conjunction with the behavior training._

**Prevention feedback or warning feedback:**

Warning feedback is a stimulus provided by the ProductNamePlaceholder Collar that occurs at three levels: audible, tactile, and static. During initial training, static correction will more effectively train your dog to respond to the audible or tactile warning-level correction. Soon, your pet will respond to just the warning as the primary correction. However, the energy level of your dog may be high enough that—even for a well-trained dog - the dog becomes distracted and ignores a warning. The static correction will overcome such significant distractions and may save your dog's life. 

**Encouragements:**

Encouragements are sounds that your dog will associate with ""good"" behavior. There are three types of encouragements that are utilized in the training:

* **Good dog**: a sound that your dog will associate with good behaviors
* **Heading home**: reinforcement for good behavior after multiple unsafe behaviors
* **Whistle**: a sound that will teach your dog to return to you

## Procedure

How to set and/or adjust the intensity levels of the encouragements and corrections:

1. Click on the **My Map** icon at the bottom of the screen.
2. Tap the pet whose settings you would like to change.
3. Swipe up on the Pet Card to open it fully.
4. Click **Feedback Settings** in the bottom right corner of the Pet Card
5. You will now see drop-down menus for **Prevention** and **Encouragement** feedback.
6. Tap either drop-down menu to see the full set of options for that kind of feedback.
7. Here, you can change the type and intensity of feedback prompts your dog receives during specific situations, such as when the collar is giving Warning Feedback, Boundary Feedback, Emergency Feedback, Good Dog, Return Whistle, or Go Home prompts.

"It is important for you to have an LTE connection because this will allow your device to connect to the internet and communicate with your application in the absence of a Bluetooth or WiFi connection.

The main benefit is that your device sends location data to your phone over LTE when there are no other connections available, so you can still monitor your activity and location as long as an LTE connection is available (it is in most places)."
"Within the [APP_NAME] App, your dog's Pet Card will give you all the information you need to know about their collar's current status.

Below is an explanation of each component of the Pet Card. Click one of the headings below to skip to that section. 

[Pet Status](#h%5F01G1P48DW8E77J78RDW0JMXJSJ)

[Bluetooth Connection Status](#h%5F01G1P49K3EYBJKHS3H87B1QEN8)

# **Pet Status**

The Pet Status represents your dog's real-time location and safety status. Here are the options for your pet's status:

Your dog is safely inside of one of their [PRODUCT_NAME] Fences, and Fences are ON (i.e. Fence mode is set to 'feedback').

Fences are OFF (i.e. Fence mode is set to 'Ignore' feedback), and you have received a status update from the [PRODUCT_NAME] Collar within the last [DURATION].

Your [PRODUCT_NAME]'s status hasn't been updated for [DURATION] or more - to learn more, see the article [ARTICLE_TITLE]([LINK]). 

Your [PRODUCT_NAME]'s status hasn't been updated in over [DURATION] - to learn more, see the article [ARTICLE_TITLE]([LINK]).

Your phone has not yet received any information from your [PRODUCT_NAME] collar. [Click here for more information on how to get your phone and [PRODUCT_NAME] collar connected. ]([LINK])

Your dog is outside of their [PRODUCT_NAME] Fence while Fences are ON (i.e. Fence mode is set to 'Feedback'). **NOTE: If you turn Fences ON while your dog is “Unsafe”, feedback will be paused until the next time your dog returns into a [PRODUCT_NAME] Fence.**

Your dog is inside the Warning Area of their Fence and is moving away from the center of the fence, or your dog is inside the Keep Away Beacon range, and is moving toward the Beacon.

# **Pet Location**

In order to know exactly where your dog is, you can check the Pet Card to see if they are currently in range of any of your Fences or Beacons.

This icon would mean that your pup is inside of your '[LOCATION_NAME]' Fence, or just left it.

This would mean that your pup is within the '[LOCATION_NAME]' Beacon range, or just left it .

# **Last Updated Time**

Your dog's [PRODUCT_NAME] Collar is always protecting them in real time. However, the [PRODUCT_NAME] needs to 'send' location information to your app so that you can see what the collar is doing. Your dog's Pet Pin location will update in real time **([DURATION])** using three different connection types: [(Bluetooth, WiFi, or cellular)]([LINK]).

The **'Last Updated Time'** indicates how recently your [APP_NAME] App received a status update from your [PRODUCT_NAME] Collar.

# **GPS Status**

GPS signal strength is **high**. This will enable all fence feedback and free movement of the collar's GPS position on the map, _so long as the motion sensors are being triggered_. 

GPS signal strength is **medium**. This status enables free movement by the collar's GPS position on the map but the collar will only issue a return whistle if it believes that it is over or near the fence boundary. 

GPS signal strength is **low**. This status will pause the collar's movement on the app and will prevent any feedback from being issued.

There are no GPS satellites in view. (Take the collar outside to an area with a clear view of the sky to calibrate)

There is no GPS data available [(click here to learn more)]([LINK]). 

# **Fence Feedback Status**

All fence feedback is enabled because of high GPS signal strength.

Fence feedback is limited to Return Whistles only, due to medium GPS signal strength.

Fence feedback is paused due to low GPS signal strength.

Fences are are set to **Ignore**.

Your pet is inside the range of a Keep Away Beacon, and is moving towards the Beacon.

Fence feedback is paused because your pet is inside the range of an Ignore Fence Beacon.

# **Network Connection Status**

Your [APP_NAME] App will report the network connection type that was most recently used by your [PRODUCT_NAME] Collar:

This icon means your collar has been connected using Wi-Fi, and the number of blue lines indicates the strength of your signal.

This icon means your collar has been connected using a Cellular connection, and the number of blue bars indicates the strength of your signal.

This icon means that there is no Wi-Fi signal on the collar. This could mean that Wi-Fi has not been configured, or is not available.

This icon means that there is no Cellular signal on the collar. This can indicate that Cellular connection is paused, or the data from the collar is 'outdated', or the collar is 'disconnected', or the data is 'unknown' because was never received from the collar.

# **Bluetooth Connection Status**

Your [APP_NAME] App can use a Bluetooth connection to receive data from your [PRODUCT_NAME] Collar instead of using an internet connection.

This icon means that your [PRODUCT_NAME] is using a Bluetooth connection to send data to your [APP_NAME] App.

This icon means that Bluetooth is disconnected.

This icon means that Bluetooth is currently disabled by your phone settings. 

This icon means that your [APP_NAME] App is receiving information about your [PRODUCT_NAME] from another smartphone that is connected to the collar via Bluetooth."
"If, while troubleshooting a connection issue, we suspect a potential issue with your Wi-Fi chip or another part of the collar, you may be asked to retrieve a System or Diagnostic log files/folder and send it to our Customer Support team for further analysis.

You will need your Collar, the charging cable that came with your collar (or another USB-C cable), and a PC or Mac. 

If you need help during this process, you can get live, one-on-one assistance in the Dog Park at [website] OR in the App at Settings > Live Help.

Follow the steps below:

1. Make sure the collar is ON (press the power button once and the Light will start blinking)
2. Observe/re-create the issue in question, if possible, by hand testing the collar.
3. Press the ON button once again (short press) to create a new diagnostic file in the collar file system.
4. Connect the collar to your computer with the USB-C cable.
5. Shut off the collar (5-second press of power button; collar will vibrate three times; let go of the power button). This action will place your collar in low power mode so that it can be recognized by your computer.
6. Open your “File Explorer"" (Windows) or “Finder"" (Mac) on your computer. Note that there should be a variety of folders on the leftmost side.

Please note that at this point, your computer will likely notify you that it has detected a new device being connected. If it does not, perform a Hard Reset (Hold the power button for 60 seconds) and try again.

7. You should see the collar appear as a USB “drive"" in your File Explorer or Finder App (likely D: or E: on a PC or “noname"" on a Mac). Double-click on the drive to open it. Inside, you will see folders named “log"", ""logs"", “config"", ""FW"", ""sgee"", and ""diags"".
8. Attach (copy and paste) the ""Log"" folder to your email reply to customer support. These files are not very large so the email should be able to handle all of the files being sent in the folder. If not, then just attach the most recent files to the email.
9. Next, attach the ""Diags"" folder which contains several .json files, to your email reply alongside the Log folder/files.  
   * If you already have an open ticket with Customer Support, then send as a reply to that email  
   * If you do not already have an open ticket, create one by sending an email to [email]  
   * If submitting logs for more than one collar or if you have more than one collar on your account, then make sure to send each collar's files in separate replies with the serial number of that collar stated in the email. The files will not indicate which collar they came from.
10. Safely eject the collar from your computer and resume using the collar by pressing the ON button to turn it on"
"## Symptoms

* Collar gives your dog Prevention Feedback while inside of the house or well within the fence boundary
* Collar shows ""High GPS"" when your dog is wearing the collar indoors

## Environment

* ProductA Collar
* ProductA App

## Background

ProductA Collars only issue fence preventions if its GPS location is next to or over the fence boundary, the dog (and collar) are moving away from safety, the collar is in **high GPS mode**, and the collar is not on the charger. When a dog wearing the collar comes inside, the collar should transition to show a **low GPS status** as it will begin to receive weaker GPS satellite signals. When showing a low GPS status, the collar will pause its position on the map at its last reported location, which is sometimes away from the house and occasionally closer to or over the fence boundary. If the collar were to pick up stronger satellite signals while in the house, which often can occur around windows, upstairs, near exterior walls/doors, and in garages, then it will transition into **medium** or high GPS mode. While in these two modes, automatic fence feedback can occur if the collar's position on the map is still near or over the fence. Some drifting of the collar's backend GPS position can naturally occur when indoors and stationary for long periods, but indoor feedback should not be an issue if the collar is staying in low GPS mode.

While working to fix this issue, you should turn fences off when your dog is in the house to prevent erroneous corrections. _**Make sure**_ **_that you turn fences back on before letting your dog out again._**

## Solutions

1. **Ensure your collar's firmware and the app are up-to-date**  
   * Check your collar’s firmware version
   * If your ProductA Collar downloads and applies a firmware update, you may be prompted to take the collar outside to allow it to re-calibrate to GPS signals. For more information on this re-calibration process, check out the article ""How to optimize GPS accuracy"" 
   * Check that your Collar has up-to-date satellite position data by checking on Settings->Collars->Advanced Settings->Satellite Position Data
2. **Ensure the perimeter of your ProductA Fence is at least <number> feet (<number> meters) away from your house**  
   * Edit your fence
   * This can help create a greater buffer area around your house to help prevent indoor feedback so the bigger the better.  
   * Adjusting the fence perimeter should also be done to allow your dog ample room to roam within the fence's safe area without getting too close to the boundary once optimum accuracy has been reached.
3. **Utilize beacons set to Ignore Fences mode**  
   * While a beacon is set to this mode, a collar that is within range of the beacon will not have any fence prevention feedback issued to it.  
   * This is a very effective option if your indoor issue consistently occurs in the same location inside your home or even outside inside your fence.
4. **Check the collar's current position on the map.**  
   * If it is showing that it is near the fence then you can take the collar in hand and bring it outside in high GPS mode so that it can update its position. Just make sure to slightly shake the collar so the sensors can be triggered which will allow a location update to be issued.  
   * It helps to open the ProductA app and to view the pet card when your dog is heading indoors or before you place the collar on them when going outside.  
         * Viewing the pet card will allow for real-time location updates to the server and app which will place the collar in a closer position to you or your house once it transitions into low GPS mode.  
         * Checking the pet card before placing the collar on your dog when going outside will allow the collar to have a more accurate starting position as the collar naturally would need to recalibrate itself some after being indoors and stationary for long periods.  
                  * The collar must have a strong or medium GPS status in order for its position on the map to update. What do the lights on the collar mean?
   * You can hand-test the collar by using the instructions
5. **If outside with the collar and it is issuing feedback even though the collar is not physically near the fence boundary, then check the app to see where the collar thinks it is.**  
   * Make sure that if the collar has not been used in some time or recently had a firmware update you allow it to calibrate out in the open.  
   * Further time outside and movement by the collar will be required in order for the collar's accuracy to increase.  
   * Taking your dog on a walk with the collar or bringing the collar in the car with you should greatly increase collar accuracy quickly due to the continuous and substantial movement.
6. **Adjust GPS Signal level settings (indoor/outdoor configuration) so the collar's Low/Strong GPS signal detection will be better optimized for your environment.**  
   * Set this so the right slider (upper threshold) is in an area that allows the collar's GPS signal to consistently be greater than the value on the slider when the collar is being **worn**. The left slider (lower threshold) should be set to a value that will mostly show the GPS signals that are making it to the collar are less than the threshold you set for it, when the collar is being worn.  
         * The low, medium, and high GPS modes are only relevant when the collar is being worn  
         * Allow a buffer area in between the two thresholds for medium GPS, which will allow the collar's position on the map to move when motion is detected but will only issue a return whistle if it thinks it is over the fence boundary.  
                  * Decided whether you would rather see the medium GPS mode lean more towards indoors or outdoors. _Personally, I would rather see the collar occasionally go into medium GPS mode when it is worn indoors or semi-outdoor environment than when outside as I would rather see full fence preventions when outside in the open in an area with a clear view of the sky._  
   * This process can be performed more than once. If it appears performance is getting worse, reach out to customer support for further assistance. A screenshot or screen recording of the issue can be helpful.  
         * If you need assistance with adjusting your levels then we ask you to share a date and time frame for when the collar was being worn by your dog and was indoors moving around and then went outdoors and moved around for about <number> minutes in both locations. Follow along from the GPS level setting page so you can view the changing signal strengths and more data can be transferred to the server. Please mention if the collar is going near large windows, garages, patios, or upstairs when doing this as these areas will naturally allow for stronger signals to reach the collar.

"This article applies to users who have the App version <APP_VERSION> or later on <PHONE_OS>, or version <APP_VERSION> or later on <PHONE_OS>. If you have an earlier version of the App, click here. Within the App, your dog's Pet Card will give you all the information you need to know about their collar's current status. Below is an explanation of each component of the Pet Card. Click one of the headings below to skip to that section. Pet Status, Pet Location, Last Updated Time, GPS Status, Fence Feedback Status, Network Connection Status, Bluetooth Connection Status. Pet Status The Pet Status represents your dog's real-time location and safety status. Here are the options for your pet's status: Safe, Tracking, Outdated, Disconnected, Unknown, Unsafe, Warning. Pet Location In order to know exactly where your dog is, you can check the Pet Card to see if they are currently in range of any of your Fences or Beacons. Last Updated Time Your dog's Collar is always protecting them in real time. However, the <COLLAR_NAME> needs to 'send' location information to your app so that you can see what the collar is doing. The frequency at which location data is sent to you depends on your connection type (Bluetooth, WiFi, or cellular). This helps to conserve battery life while keeping you up-to-date. The 'Last Updated Time' indicates how recently your App received a status update from your Collar. To view your dog's current location at any time, tap the Refresh button on your My Map screen while your phone and collar both have a network connection.

| **FIRST STEP: Remove the collar from the charger** Before placing the Collar onto your pet, always remove it from the charger. |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

**Objective**

* Place the Collar onto your dog in a comfortable and effective way

**Environment**

* Collar

**Procedure**

In order to provide proper feedback to your dog, the strap and Collar must fit your dog properly. If the collar is too loose or positioned incorrectly, feedback may be inconsistent. This can delay or prevent successful training.

### Follow these steps to correctly position the Collar. [If you need to adjust the fit, see the directions below the diagram](#h%5F01EE13K53ZXHP45CEPEWX97BYE):

1. Place the Collar around the middle of your dog's neck.
2. Position the Collar at the front of your dog's neck, with the speaker facing toward your dog's ear and the contact tips touching the skin. _See the figure below._  
   * **Note:** The [LOGO] stitching on the Protective Soft Case should be under your dog's chin
3. Tighten the strap so that it is securely around the dog's neck, then fasten the buckle. You should be able to fit two fingers between the collar strap and your dog’s neck. Wiggle the Collar to work the contact tips through the dog's coat and touch the skin.

**NOTE:** The collar should fit tightly and should be snug so that it does not rotate or slide on the dog's neck. The dog must be able to swallow food and water normally. You should observe your dog's behavior to verify that the collar is not too tight. _**The contact tips must have contact with the dog's skin to be effective.**_  

![GPS_gray_collarpositioning.png](/hc/article_attachments/[NUMBER])

#### Your Collar ships with the size strap you ordered (small, medium, or large). Within each size, the collar is adjustable to be made slightly smaller or larger for a proper fit for your dog.

### If you need to adjust the included strap, follow these instructions:

**Note:** The four holes are where the Collar’s contact tips should be installed.

1. Attach the Collar unit to the strap if it has not already been installed. [How do I attach the Collar to the provided strap?](/[URL])
2. Place the Collar around the middle of your dog's neck.
3. Position the Collar at the side of your dog's neck, with the speaker facing toward your dog's ear and the contact tips touching the skin.  
   * **Note:** The [LOGO] logo stitching on the Protective Soft Case should be under your dog's chin
4. Fit and adjust your snap/clip-style strap to your dog’s neck.
5. Check to see if the Collar unit is positioned correctly in front of your dog's neck.
6. Remove the Collar from your dog.
7. Unscrew and remove the Collar’s installed contact tips. Note which holes these contacts are installed.
8. Open the two Retention Loops by unscrewing the two thumbscrews and releasing that end of each loop.
9. Remove the Halo strap carefully from each retention loop
10. If necessary, cut the excesses strap but leave a [NUMBER]-[NUMBER] inch ([NUMBER]-[NUMBER] cm) tail so that it can be tucked into the Collar unit.
11. If the Collar unit was not positioned properly for your dog's neck size, to fit a smaller neck - install the unit in the two closes holes to the buckle or to fit a larger neck - install the unit in the two holes closest to the clip. If the pre-punched holes do not give the needed fit, feel free to punch your own holes.
12. Attach the Collar unit by screwing in both of the original contact tips.
13. Close the two Retention Loops by hand screwing the two thumbscrews.
14. Tuck the excess strap in to the Collar Retention Loop.

**NOTE:** After installation, a snap- or clip-style strap will not be easily adjustable. The position of the Collar should be at the front of your dog's neck, with the speaker facing toward your dog's chin and the contact tips touching the skin.

**Your assembled strap should look similar to the assembled strap below when attached:**

**![Screen_Shot_[DATE]_[TIME].png](/hc/article_attachments/[NUMBER]/Screen_Shot_[DATE]_[TIME].png)**

#### If you wish to replace the provided strap with your own strap, follow the instructions below or in the article [how do I replace the provided strap?](/[URL]):

1. Fit and adjust the provided snap/clip-style strap to your dog’s neck before starting. (If a [BRAND] strap was already installed, follow steps [NUMBER]-[NUMBER] to remove it first).
2. Unscrew and remove – but keep - the Collar’s installed contact tips. You will need these in step [NUMBER].
3. Open the two Retention Loops by unscrewing the two thumbscrews and releasing that end of each loop.
4. Remove the Halo strap carefully from each retention loop
5. Using the [BRAND] strap as a guide, punch two retention holes in _your_ own collar. The location of these holes should be at the same positions as on the [BRAND] strap—as measured from the buckle-end.  
_**NOTE:** This typically requires punching each hole through two layers of your snap- or clip-type strap. If so, the ‘snap/clip-style’ strap will not be adjustable after Collar installation._
6. Slide your strap in place and align the two retention holes with the contact tip locations on the Collar.
7. Close and secure each of the retention loops around the strap by closing the loop and hand-tightening each thumbscrew.
8. Screw both of the original contact tips through the strap into the Collar unit.
9. Put the collar on your dog and begin training in the [APP_NAME] App.

"## Environment

* DeviceA
* AppA
* DeviceB

## Answer

Feedback is one of the most important tools of the SystemA. There are two types of feedback that the collar provides:

* Prevention Feedback
* Encouragement Feedback

We will focus on **Prevention feedback** for this exercise. Prevention feedback works to teach your dog to respect boundaries that you create with your FenceA and either stop or turn around to head back to safety after the collar issues the feedback.

**1. Warning Feedback** - Low to Medium distraction that warns your dog that a boundary is ahead

**2. Boundary Feedback** - Medium to high distraction and prevents your dog from crossing the boundary

**3. Emergency Feedback** - High distraction and meant to prevent your dog from remaining outside of the boundary if they leave it.

* Important Note: When setting up your feedback settings, be sure to find the right setting that catches your dog's attention without startling them. It is best to start at a lower setting and work your way up until you find the setting that works best.
* View this article to understand how to [manage your feedback settings.](link1)

# DeviceB Training Exercise

One of the main purposes of starting inside is so that distractions are minimal. This allows for your dog to better understand the feedback they are hearing/feeling from the collar.

During the indoor beacon training, your dog will be learning two simple commands: 

1. Keep away from boundaries
2. Come back to safety
* Spend 30 minutes performing this exercise

Make sure that you add the DeviceB to your app and turn it on. Ensure that your pet card has beacon's set to ""listen"".

_Prepping your room for training:_

* Put your dog in another room as you set up the environment for your beacon training.
* We will use a container to house your enticing smelling food and/or smell. (It is recommended to use a container that comes up to the dog's neck so that they can see the treat but not easily grab the treat).
* Place the enticing smell or food item in the container along with the DeviceB while it is inside of a bag.

Let your pup in to explore while attached to a lead or leash, but don't walk with them. The strong smell should entice them and when they approach the beacon, their collar should receive feedback.

* **Important:** If they don't respond to the feedback, use the leash to gently guide your dog back to you and another high value treat to assist with guiding them back to you.  
   * Reward your dog with praise and love to achieve the goal for your dog understanding to associate the feedback with ""Staying Away"" from the location you have set up the training exercise.

Use a treat to guide your dog back to you once they successfully acknowledge and respond to the feedback.

* AppNamePlaceholder App

Keeping your pet safe is a top priority. Understanding the nuances of your pet's behavior and interactions with safety measures like fences is crucial. The **Safety Card** provides valuable insights into your pet's activities, highlighting key statistics that shed light on their safety within and outside the designated safe zones.

In the AppNamePlaceholder App, go to the the **My Map** tab. Select your pet's name under **find & manage pets** and swipe up to enlarge the pet card, you will find there are statistics that you can view!

## Safety Score Card

![](/hc/article_attachments/23156689377687)

**Safe -** This metric indicates how long your pet remained within the safe zone, protected by the fence.

**Unsafe -** Contrary to the safe metric, the unsafe category reveals instances when your pet ventured beyond the safe zone despite the fences being activated. It quantifies the duration your pet spent outside the protected area, alerting you to potential vulnerabilities or breaches in the safety measures.

**Tracking** \- The tracking metric offers insight into the periods when the fences were deactivated or turned off for your pet and it measures the duration during which your pet was not under the direct protection of the fence.

**Note**: The time, when the collar is charging or is turned off, is not accounted in the '_Safety_' card stats calculation.

## View History

![](/hc/article_attachments/23156689379095)

You can easily access your pet's Safety Card History by tapping the ""**View History**"" button and then you are able to navigate to the detailed report. Let's take a look at that and see how it will be displayed!

## Safety History

There will be a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly report found.

**Safe** \- Sum of periods when your pet was in a safe area.  
**Unsafe** \- Sum of periods when your pet was in an unsafe area.  
**Tracking** \- Sum of periods when the fences were turned off.  
**On Charger** \- Sum of periods when the collar was on the charger.

![pets_report_tracking_day.png](/hc/article_attachments/23156658523543)

**Note**: The ""On Charger"" data is displayed within the Safety report but not as a separate type of data in the ""Statistics"" section. The ""On Charger"" value includes time when the collar is turned off as well. This means that the ""On Charger"" value can encompass time when the collar is either on the charger or turned off. NumberPlaceholder bars can be displayed for one day, and a bar or part of a bar isn't displayed if there is no data about the pet's tracking.

**Bluetooth Disclaimer**:  
When accessing your pet's report within the app, the Bluetooth connection with the collar will be automatically disabled. Upon closing the report, the app will enable Bluetooth.

"## Symptoms

* You plug in your [Device Name], but the green battery light doesn't come on, making it seem unresponsive or dead.

## Environment

* [Device Name]

## Resolution

1. Check the charging cable to make sure it is securely connected to the [Device Name] and charging adapter.
2. Use a different charging cable, adapter or outlet to rule out any potential issues with the charger.
3. Check for any debris or corrosion on the charging contacts of the [Device Name] and clean them if necessary.

Should all of these things be true, and your [Device Name] still isn't charging, let's proceed with troubleshooting the [Device Name] itself:

1. Place the [Device Name] on a flat surface with the charging port facing upwards.
2. Ensure the charger is not plugged into the [Device Name].
3. Press and hold the button on the [Device Name] for 15 seconds.
4. After 15 seconds, the battery light will begin flashing green.
5. Connect the [Device Name] to the charger to charge it normally.

  
**If the initial reset attempt is unsuccessful:**

1. Plug the [Device Name] into the charger, then unplug it once more.
2. Flip the charging cable 180° (upside down) and plug it back into the [Device Name] again.
3. Press the power button for 60 seconds.
4. After this, leave the [Device Name] on the charger for at least 1 hour; a longer duration is preferable.
5. Lastly, perform another 60-second hard reset with the [Device Name] on a flat surface and the charging cable facing upwards.

If the [Device Name] does not immediately power on, it should start accepting a charge now and cycle on in about 30 minutes.

## Additional Notes

* Check for dirt or debris in the charging port. Rinse out the port and then tap out water and allow it to air dry. Once **fully dry**, plug it into the charger.

"The [Product Name] works seamlessly with [Product Feature] to keep your dog contained, regardless of what type of connection your collar is using. 

At any given moment, the collar will choose the best connection available to communicate with your [Product Component]. The options are [Connection Type 1], [Connection Type 2], and [Connection Type 3].

[Connection Type 1]

[Connection Type 1] is available when you and your phone are within approximately [Distance] ([Distance]). To enable a [Connection Type 1] connection, navigate to your phone’s settings app, click [Connection Type 1], and make sure [Connection Type 1] is toggled to “ON."" 

* For [Phone Type] users only, confirm that new [Connection Type 1] connections are enabled by navigating to the [Phone Feature] and making sure that the circle containing the [Connection Type 1] logo is toggled to ON (filled in [Color])

You don't need to look for the collar in your phone's [Connection Type 1] devices list; the collar will automatically connect to your phone if your [Connection Type 1] is on. 

We strongly recommend that you always have [Connection Type 1] on when you are using the [Product Component] and within [Distance] ([Distance]) of your dog, because a [Connection Type 1] connection gives certain benefits:

* Your dog's [Data Type 1] information and [Data Type 2] location will update in real time (every [Time]), as long as the [Interface Element] is open. For example, if you want to take your dog for a walk and track its location in real time, then you need to use a [Connection Type 1] connection and keep your [Interface Element] open. Other connection types send data to your phone at regular intervals, but not as often as when connected by [Connection Type 1] (more details below).
* [Feature Name] - or '[Alternative Feature Name]' - register immediately on your dog's [Product Name] when connected via [Connection Type 1]. The moment you press the button in your [Product Component], the collar performs the selected feedback. Without [Connection Type 1], the collar will perform the feedback once the request reaches the collar over the internet, which could take [Time] (or longer if you don’t have good connection). [Feature Name] are an important reason to use [Connection Type 1].  
   * Note: To access [Feature Name], press the [Color 1] and [Color 2] hand icon in the top left corner of the [Interface Element] or the [Color 1] and [Color 2] hand icon in the top right corner of the [Interface Element].

[Connection Type 2]

It is important to configure your [Product Name] to connect with your home [Connection Type 2] network, because your collar will automatically download and apply [Software Type] updates when it is both plugged into power and connected to [Connection Type 2]. We recommend you configure your collar to the [Connection Type 2] network at home and anywhere else that you frequent, such as a friend's house. 

When your [Product Name] is connected over [Connection Type 2], the [Data Type 2]'s position will update approximately every [Time] on your [Screen Name] screen.

For instructions on connecting your collar to your [Connection Type 2] network, check out the article ""[Article Title]""

[Connection Type 3]

If you are out of [Connection Type 1] range and not on a [Connection Type 2] network, the collar will default to an [Connection Type 3] connection. If the [Product Name] is connected over [Connection Type 3], it will update the data and location on the [Interface Element] every [Time].

Additional Notes

The above update rates are applicable to when your dog is outdoors and moving around. When resting or indoors, other [Interface Element] data (such as the battery level) will update periodically, but your dog’s [Data Type 2] location will not move. When your dog is resting, its position is not changing, so the [Data Type 2] will not move. When your dog is indoors, [Signal Type] signals are erratic, so the [Product Name] stops tracking your dog’s location; instead, the position of the [Data Type 2] should remain fixed to your dog’s last outdoor position (i.e. the spot where they re-entered your house). This indoor mode is made apparent by the ‘home’ icon on the [Data Type 2] and the ‘[Mode Name]’ indication on the [Interface Element]."
"## Environment

* Product_A
* App_A
* Device_A

## Answer

Feedback is one of the most important tools of the System_A. There are two types of feedback that the collar provides:

* Prevention Feedback
* Encouragement Feedback

We will focus on **Prevention feedback** for this exercise. Prevention feedback works to teach your dog to respect boundaries that you create with your Fence_A and either stop or turn around to head back to safety after the collar issues the feedback.

**1. Warning Feedback** - Low to Medium distraction that warns your dog that a boundary is ahead

**2. Boundary Feedback** - Medium to high distraction and prevents your dog from crossing the boundary

**3. Emergency Feedback** - High distraction and meant to prevent your dog from remaining outside of the boundary if they leave it.

* Important Note: When setting up your feedback settings, be sure to find the right setting that catches your dog's attention without startling them. It is best to start at a lower setting and work your way up until you find the setting that works best.
* View this article to understand how to [manage your feedback settings.](URL_A)

# Device_A Training Exercise

One of the main purposes of starting inside is so that distractions are minimal. This allows for your dog to better understand the feedback they are hearing/feeling from the collar.

During the indoor beacon training, your dog will be learning two simple commands: 

1. Keep away from boundaries
2. Come back to safety
* Spend 30 minutes performing this exercise

Make sure that you add the Device_A to your app and turn it on. Ensure that your pet card has beacon's set to ""listen"".

_Prepping your room for training:_

* Put your dog in another room as you set up the environment for your beacon training.
* We will use a container to house your enticing smelling food and/or smell. (It is recommended to use a container that comes up to the dog's neck so that they can see the treat but not easily grab the treat).
* Place the enticing smell or food item in the container along with the Device_A while it is inside of a bag.

Let your pup in to explore while attached to a lead or leash, but don't walk with them. The strong smell should entice them and when they approach the beacon, their collar should receive feedback.

* **Important:** If they don't respond to the feedback, use the leash to gently guide your dog back to you and another high value treat to assist with guiding them back to you.  
   * Reward your dog with praise and love to achieve the goal for your dog understanding to associate the feedback with ""Staying Away"" from the location you have set up the training exercise.

Use a treat to guide your dog back to you once they successfully acknowledge and respond to the feedback.

"We have developed historical charts and graphs to review the performance of the App for your pet. This feature allows you to access information including Preventions, Tracking, Distance Walked, and Activity.

To view this information, open your App and select the Pet Card for the pet that you want to view the activity for. While inside the Pet Card, see the section Tracking For Today and select View More to see that pet's detailed tracking information.

## Preventions:

This graph shows the number of times your dog receives each type of Prevention Feedback. 

* Warning - Your dog comes into the Warning Area of a Fence Boundary (DISTANCE_UNIT) or Halo Beacon (DISTANCE_UNIT) and is still moving towards the fence/beacon.
* Boundary – Your dog is ignoring the Warning Feedback for more than DURATION and continues to move towards the fence/beacon.
* Emergency - Your dog has passed the fence boundary and continues to move away from safety.

[IMAGE]

## Tracking:

This graph shows the time your pet is safe (inside a fence with fences on), unsafe (outside all fences with fences on), fences off (time that you had fences off), and time Halo was on the charger. This chart allows you to see the data by day, or narrow down to each hour of a selected day. All HOURS of the day should fall into one of these categories, unless the collar is turned off or powered down (which it should never be).

## Distance Walked:

This graph shows the total distance walked/run by the dog (does not include driving distance) as calculated/estimated by the GPS chip and collar activity sensor. The Walk Count shown on the pet card increments only when you turn fences off, leave the fence with your dog, and travel more than DISTANCE_UNIT. The walk ends when you return to your fence or you turn fence mode on.

"It's important to note that these statistics are derived from collated data, providing a comprehensive overview of your pet's safety habits. By analyzing these metrics, you can identify patterns, address potential safety concerns, and make informed decisions to enhance your pet's well-being and security.

[FeedbackName] scores are a useful tool for you to see how effectively your dog responds to [WarningName]. They range from 1 to 100, with 100 representing the best score.

This score is not a percentage success rate, but rather a percentile of success relative to other dogs with [ProductName] collars. 

**What do these scores mean?**

* If your dog's [WarningName] Response Score is **high**, that means that they always or almost always turn around and head back to safety when they are prompted with [WarningName].
* If your dog's [WarningName] Response Score is **low**, that means that they often do not respond properly to the [WarningName], and are subsequently prompted with [BoundaryName] and [EmergencyName].

**What might be causing a low score?**

If your dog is consistently ignoring [WarningName] and triggering [BoundaryName] and [EmergencyName], then that may indicate one of two issues:

1. Your dog does not feel or notice when their [ProductName] gives them [WarningName]; or
2. They notice the [WarningName], but do not know how to properly respond to it

**If your dog is not noticing the [WarningName], then you need to make sure that:**

* **The collar is fit snugly around their neck, with the contact tips touching their skin**. If the collar is too loose and the contact tips are not touching the skin, then your dog may not feel the feedback they are receiving. To ensure your pup's collar is fitted properly, follow the instructions in the article [""How to fit the [ProductName]""](URL)
* **The feedback settings are not high enough to get your dog's attention.** If this may be the case, then go back to the training module in which you determined the proper feedback levels for your pup, to ensure that they can hear or feel the feedback from their [ProductName].

**If your dog is noticing the [WarningName], but does not know how to properly respond:**

* You need to revisit [TrainingName] with them to make sure they understand that feedback means they need to stop, turn around, and head back to safety.
* Work with your pup to build the association between the sound or vibration of the collar and the need to turn around. Continue practicing this, per the training module, until your pup demonstrates a clear understanding of the association between the prompt and response.

[ChartName] can be sorted weekly, monthly, or annually, so you can see how your pup's response rate has changed over time. "
"**Objective:**

* Test the contact tips to make sure the static feedback is working properly

**Environment:**

* [Product Name]

**Background:**

* If you would like to test the [Product Name]'s static feedback on yourself to make sure that it is working, please **make sure that you are touching both contact tips simultaneously when you administer the feedback.**
   * If you are only touching one of the tips, you may not feel anything. The tips need to both be in contact with a surface in order to properly emit the static feedback.
* **We recommend that you test the static on a fleshy part of your skin, such as on your forearm or thigh.**
* When you are testing, remember that the static feedback is not designed to be punitive or painful; it is intended to provide a tactile sensation that will get your dog's attention.

**Procedure:**

When you're ready to test:

1. Select the Pet Card associated with the collar that you would like to test
2. Access the Instant Feedback feature by tapping the blue and white hand icon to the left of your pet's name
3. Put both contact tips against your skin. We recommend testing on your forearm or thigh. **Do not use the palm of your hand.**
4. If static feedback is set as your Emergency Feedback option, then tap the '**Emergency**' icon in the Instant Feedback screen, and you should feel the static output as long as both contact tips are touching your skin simultaneously.
5. If you need to alter the intensity of the static output, swipe up on the Pet Card, then tap **Feedback Settings** in the bottom right corner. Tap **Prevention**, then **Emergency Feedback** (or whichever level of feedback you have static set for). Here, you can slide your finger to adjust the static level between 1 and 15, for whatever intensity is most appropriate for testing or for your dog.
   * If you change the setting for testing on yourself, please remember to change it back to the appropriate number for your pet when you are done testing."

## Answer

A Product Boundary is a virtual boundary that works with your Product to keep your pet(s) contained in a certain geographical area. A Product Boundary can be comprised of up to <NUMBER> boundary posts, so your boundary can be uniquely shaped to fit your needs. Product Pack <redacted> Members can have up to <NUMBER> Boundaries, Product Pack <redacted> Members have up to <NUMBER> and Product Pack <redacted> Members have unlimited Boundaries. To create a boundary, follow the steps in [this article.](https://support.company.com/hc/en-us/articles/000000000000) 

Your boundaries will not interfere with each other! You can set one up at a family or friend member's home while keeping your boundary saved at your home.

If your pet tries to cross a Product Boundary boundary while wearing the Product, the product will give them Prevention Feedback to keep them inside the boundary. This [Prevention Feedback can be customized](https://support.company.com/hc/en-us/articles/000000000000) with prompts such as sounds, vibrations, or static pulses. You will receive a notification from the Product Application if your pet receives Prevention Feedback. 

The GPS coordinates of a Product Boundary are automatically downloaded to the product and remain there permanently (unless you edit or delete them). A Product Boundary cannot be cut, damaged, jumped over, or dug under, and it doesn't require any maintenance.

* Explain how to turn Halo Fences on or off for your pet(s)

**Environment**

* Halo App

**Procedure**

Follow these steps to turn on all fences for a pet:

1. Click the ""**My Map**"" icon in the lower-left corner of the screen.
2. Then click your pet icon under ""Find and Manage Pets""
3. Slide up the Pet detail card and click the button next to **""Fences**""
4. The button will turn blue and the label will change from **""** **Ignore"" to **""Feedback**""
5. This will turn on all fences associated with that pet.  
   * **Important Note:** Make sure that it says **""Synchronized**"" in the top right corner of the **""Feedback for (pet's name)""** on the Pet Card. If it says **""Synchronizing**"" then the information is still in the process of being transferred from your Halo App to the Halo Collar, and the fences are not on yet.  
         
   This image indicates that your fences are **turned on** manually  
   ![Screenshot_2023-04-27_175105.png](/hc/article_attachments/14207020428823)

Follow these steps to turn off all fences for a pet:

1. Click the ""**My Map**"" icon in the lower-left corner of the screen.
2. Then click your pet icon under ""Find and Manage Pets""
3. Slide up the Pet detail card and click the button next to **""Fences**""
4. The button will turn gray and the label will change to **""Ignore**""
5. This will turn off all fences associated with that pet.  
   * **Important Note:** Make sure that it says **""Synchronized**"" in the top right corner of the **""Feedback for (pet's name)""** on the Pet Card. If it says **""Synchronizing**"" then the information is still in the process of being transferred from your Halo App to the Halo Collar, and the fences are not off yet.

 This image indicates that your fences are **turned off** manually  

![IMG_0413.jpg](/hc/article_attachments/14207018407959)

**Additional Notes**

**Note:** It is possible to select only one pet and enable or disable fences just for that one pet – but the on or off status will apply to ALL fences for that pet. 

When a fence is enabled/disabled, a message is sent to the Halo System from the app about what action is needed for the fence. The app then sends that message to the Halo collar. 

Be sure to check that your app is synchronized with the collar before assuming the fences are on or off. If the message was not sent to the collar, the collar will still think the fences are on/off even if the app shows the change you made. See the image below for where you should look to see if the app and collar are synchronized. If it says 'synchronizing,' that means that the app is still in the process of communicating with the collar, and your changes haven't been implemented yet.

"**Surroundings**

* Application: [Name] App

**Largest barrier dimensions:** You can create a [Name] barrier practically as large as needed. A single section of a [Name] barrier (the space between two barrier markers) can extend up to 10 kilometers, or 6.2 miles. Constructing a barrier with 20 barrier markers (the maximum permitted), each spaced at the maximum distance, would enclose roughly 3,156 sq. kilometers, exceeding 1,200 sq. miles, or 780 thousand acres.

**Smallest barrier dimensions:** We suggest a minimum [Name] barrier size of at least 30 feet by 30 feet (9.1 by 9.1 meters) to provide your canine companion with sufficient safe roaming space.

* Note that the Alert Zone starts approximately 7-10 feet (2.1-3.0 meters) inside the barrier boundary. This necessitates providing your dog with ample space to move freely without activating the collar's Alert Response.
* For instance, a 20x20 (6.1x6.1) barrier with a 10-foot (3.0 meter) Alert Zone on each side effectively reduces your dog's roaming area to 10 feet by 10 feet (3.0 meters by 3.0 meters).
* Therefore, position your [Name] barriers in locations offering maximum space for your dog's movement.

Maintain a minimum distance of 15 feet (4.6 meters) between [Name] barrier boundaries and any structure (like your residence). Due to inherent variations in GPS tracking of several feet, this 15-foot (4.6 meter) buffer prevents boundary overlap with your house and provides adequate space for your dog to move without triggering Alert Responses.

* Walk you through the steps to make sure you're only paying for the items you have.

### Environment

* [Website](/url_redacted)
* App
* The number of items on your Plan is the same as the number of items listed in your App

### Procedure to Add a New Item

1. **FIRST**, go to the website, [/url_redacted] log into your Account and navigate to your My Account dashboard.
2. Select ""Change Plan""
![](/hc/article_attachments/19402111374871)
3. Increment the number of items on your Plan and select Agree & Pay to save the change to your Plan. You will be charged a prorated amount to increase the number of items on your Plan.
4. **THEN**, use your App to add your new item. Follow [/article_redacted] for information on how to **add** an item using your App.

### Procedure to Remove an Existing Item

1. **FIRST**, use your App to delete the item from the list in the App. Follow [/article_redacted] for information on how to **remove** an item using your App.
2. **THEN**, go to the website, [/url_redacted] log into your Account and navigate to your My Account dashboard.
3. Select ""Change Plan"" 
![](/hc/article_attachments/19402111374871)
4. Now, decrement the number of items on your Plan and select Agree & Pay to update your plan. A prorated credit will be applied to your next invoice.

### Remember

1. Before you can add a new item using your App, you must have at least that many items on your Plan. For example, if you have 1 item on your Plan, you will not be able to add a 2nd item to your App - you must increase the number of items on your Plan **first**.  
2. Before you can lower the quantity of items on your Plan, you must not have more items in your App. For example, if you have 3 items listed in your App, you cannot reduce your Plan to fewer than 3 items. If there is an item listed in your App that you no longer have, you need to delete it first using the App. Then, you can reduce the number of items on your Plan.
3. Follow [/article_redacted] for information on how to **remove or add** an item using your App.

In scenarios where your fence intersects a road or is unavoidably close to one, the use of Zone Beacons becomes essential. Placing these beacons on building corners or near the road can create an additional layer of containment, alerting your dog to stay within the safe confines of your property.

**Image Insert:**

### **Fences Excluding Buildings:**

For properties where the fence is primarily in the front or backyard, excluding the building, there are clever ways to manage your dog's movement. An 'Ignore Fences' beacon can be positioned near the entrance of the building. This allows your dog to pass through the boundary without receiving feedback, making it safe for them to enter and exit the home.

**Image Insert:**

### **Pack Walk Feature:**

Another innovative solution is the Collar's Pack Walk feature. <details to be added>

## Additional Notes

* The optimal Fence size is a space of at least 30x30 feet, ensuring ample room for your dog to roam and play. It's crucial to maintain a minimum distance of 15-20 feet (4.6-6.1 meters) between the fence and any roads or hazards. This buffer zone reduces the risk of your dog venturing into dangerous areas and provides peace of mind."

"The <PRODUCT> is a sophisticated tool designed to keep your dog safe while giving you peace of mind. It combines <TECHNOLOGY> technology and connectivity features to offer a comprehensive solution for pet tracking and safety. Here’s an in-depth look at how these features work, both independently and together.

### _<TECHNOLOGY> & Connectivity - Separate but Complementary_

**<TECHNOLOGY> Functionality**

The <TECHNOLOGY> feature of the <PRODUCT> operates independently of the collar’s connectivity to your devices (<DEVICE> or <DEVICE>). This independence is crucial for ensuring your dog’s safety even in areas with poor or no internet connection. The <TECHNOLOGY> system in the collar uses ephemeris data, which helps pinpoint the collar’s location based on <TECHNOLOGY> coordinates. This means the collar can determine your dog’s location reliably, regardless of whether it is connected to <CONNECTIVITY>, <CONNECTIVITY>, or <CONNECTIVITY>.

**Ensuring Your Dog’s Safety Without Connectivity**

One of the key advantages of the <PRODUCT> is that it doesn’t rely on connectivity to keep your dog within safe boundaries. Here’s how it works:

**<TECHNOLOGY> Fence Feedback Without Connectivity**

Your collar will still issue feedback to your dog if the following two conditions are met:

* **Movement Towards and Through the Fence:** The collar must detect that your dog is moving towards and through the virtual fence boundary.
* **High <TECHNOLOGY> Mode:** The collar must be set to High <TECHNOLOGY> mode. This ensures the <TECHNOLOGY> data is accurate and the collar can determine your dog’s exact location relative to the fence.

When these conditions are satisfied, the collar will apply the necessary feedback to your dog to prevent it from crossing the fence, regardless of the collar’s connection status. This feature is particularly beneficial in rural areas or locations with unstable connectivity, ensuring continuous safety for your dog.

### Connectivity

Connectivity, on the other hand, is what links the collar to the <APP> app on your smartphone. This connection enables various real-time features such as live tracking, creating virtual fences, receiving notifications, and sending manual feedback from the app. However, these features require a stable connection to function correctly.

**Practical Applications of Connectivity**

1. Live Tracking: Use the app to monitor your dog’s location in real-time when the collar is connected.
2. Fence Creation: Set up virtual fences through the app to establish safe zones for your dog.
3. Notifications: Receive alerts and updates about your dog’s location and activity.
4. Manual Feedback: Send commands or feedback to the collar directly from the app.  
    
And much more!

**Conclusion**

The <PRODUCT>’s robust design, combining <TECHNOLOGY> and connectivity features, ensures your dog’s safety is never compromised. By understanding the distinct roles of <TECHNOLOGY> and connectivity, you can make the most of the collar’s capabilities, keeping your pet secure and giving yourself peace of mind, no matter where you are. Whether in a connectivity-rich environment or a remote location, the <PRODUCT> stands out as a reliable and effective solution for pet safety."
"The <redacted> Collar will protect your dog even if you have no Wi-Fi and poor or nonexistent cellular coverage.

**You should set up your <redacted> Fences before you leave/while you still have Wi-Fi, and they will work seamlessly upon your arrival. <redacted> Fences are stored in the collar's memory and won't be lost, even if the collar loses power or internet connection.**

The only features that would be affected if your dog's <redacted> Collar does not have a cellular connection are:

* Its ability to send notifications to your phone
* Its ability to display its live location on your My Map screen.

As long as you're able to connect to Wi-Fi while creating and editing your fences, you can send these changes from your phone to the collar without any issues.

After that, your <redacted> Fences will automatically communicate with your dog's <redacted> Collar through GPS. If you're within Bluetooth range of your dog, or if your dog's <redacted> Collar is in Wi-Fi range, you won't need a cellular connection at all--and you will still be able to receive notifications and see your dog's pet pin location on your My Map screen."

"When a pet starts to learn where the boundary is on their owner's property, they may be hesitant to cross that boundary, even when fences are off (i.e. if their owner is taking them on a walk).

However, over time a pet will learn that they can pass that boundary when on the leash and with their human. Owners just need to make sure to turn off fences when they are going to leave the house with their pet so that they don't receive Prevention Feedback when they cross the boundary.

## Additional Notes

Make sure to move confidently past the normal location of your fence boundary without hesitation - the pet will feel that confidence and begin to understand the conditions of when they can and cannot cross that boundary. 

* **The Ignore Fences Beacon Function** serves as a great feature of the beacon because it allows owners to place a beacon in their pocket and once they set it to **Ignore Fences** mode in the settings, they can walk through their boundary without ever having to turn their fences off. Some users place an ""**I** **gnore Fences""** beacon in their car so that when they take their pet on a ride, they can just drive through the boundary as the beacon protects the collar from receiving **any feedback!**  
    
As long as the collar is within range of the beacon in ignore fences mode, it will not receive feedback. For more information on how to adjust the beacon settings, please visit our [Beacon Functions: Keep Away vs. Ignore Fences article](invalid URL)."
"## Environment

* Halo Beacons

## Answer

The beacon range is adjustable and isn't fixed to a specific number of feet per range level. Think of it as an adjustment of signal strength. Increasing the range expands the transmission radius, and decreasing it reduces the radius.

The beacon's radius is spherical, meaning if you increase the range, your pup might receive feedback even on another floor. You'll need to experiment to find the optimal setting that meets your specific needs. This radius will work both in keep away mode & ignore fences functions.

Let's take a look at a use case where you'd like to keep your dog out of the kitchen using the **keep away function**. 

_**Take note**_ of the red 'X' marks. These marks represent the points which warning feedback will be applied on the outermost 'X' and then boundary feedback on the second ""X' as your pup approaches the beacon.

![](/hc/article_attachments/23539455771799)

On the contrary, you can use the **ignore fences function** to walk with your dog through your fence outside while going for a walk or a drive and the collar will not receive any feedback. Let's take a look at a visual representation of this 'dome' of protection below.

So long as your pup's collar is within range (Blue Circle) of the ignore fences beacon on your person, no feedback will be issued at the fence warning zone, allowing you to pass through.

"**Product:**

* [REDACTED]

**Response**

**NOTE:** _Please understand that it is essential to review the training modules in your [REDACTED], which cover this information in great detail. Reading support articles is not a substitute for thoroughly completing both the user and pet training programs._ 

With the [REDACTED], we don't train your dog to learn a specific boundary line or location on your property. Rather, we train that Prevention Feedback means ‘fence’ (Fast beeping is the default Warning Feedback), and ‘fence’ means to stop, turn around and head back to safety. 

This is important because it teaches your dog a universal signal that breaks their fixation (or distraction), and then means they need to stop what they're doing and turn around. As such, you can take your dog to a friend's yard, the beach, the park, or anywhere else and set up a [REDACTED], with the confidence that your dog will turn around when they hear the Warning Feedback - even if they are in an unfamiliar location. 

So you don't need to worry about the exact coordinates of the [REDACTED] in your yard or anywhere else; as long as the dog receives Prevention Feedback at the boundary, he or she will know to stop and go back into their safe zone. 

That said, please make sure your [REDACTED] boundaries are at least [REDACTED] from your house and [REDACTED] from a road or other dangerous areas.

**Note:** You can [customize your [REDACTED]'s feedback settings]([REDACTED]), so it doesn't need to be a 'beep' - you can also use a variety of vibration patterns or static correction to teach your dog to stop what they're doing and head back to safety. Also, as a reminder, there are escalating levels of Prevention Feedback intended to break your dog’s fixation if they are too distracted to respond to the initial feedback."
"We recommend that you do not use the Product on a puppy until they have reached _at least_ 5 months of age. The reason that we recommend waiting until your dog is at least 5 months old is due to the fact that puppies develop in stages. This is true both physically and mentally. 

Similarly to how children's brains develop in stages, puppies need time to mature before boundary awareness becomes second-nature to them. We've consulted with Expert and other expert trainers, who agree that 5-6 months+ is the best timeframe to begin using a wireless dog fence system. When they are at least 5-6 months of age, puppies begin to reach a stage of development where advanced concepts, such as avoiding unseen boundaries, will start to make sense to them. 

Our experts have advised us that 8 weeks is too early to begin using systems like these, which is why our recommendation is not simply based upon a dog's physical size or what other systems use as guidelines. At Company, our top priority is the safety and welfare of all dogs! As a result, we've decided to heed the experts' recommendations about this ideal age range."
"## Environment

* Product_A

## Answer

The Product_A itself is an electronic unit that comes in one size and attaches to a strap - this strap is what comes in multiple sizes. You can also choose to attach the Product_A to your own strap. 

The Product_A is flexible, comfortable, and its durable design makes it a great fit for dogs that weigh a minimum of WEIGHT_A-WEIGHT_B (WEIGHT_C-WEIGHT_D kg) and are typically over AGE_A months old. When you purchase your Product_A kit, you choose a size for the strap and it is this strap that has a size associated with it or you can use your own dog collar. If you decide to use the strap that comes with the collar and your dog is in between sizes, we recommend getting the larger size since you can trim it down to fit your dog.

In the event that you have a growing dog and/or you find that you have not measured properly, you can order a new strap on our [Parts & Accessories page](URL_A).

"Our most recent Firmware update (Version <NUMBER>) significantly extends your <PRODUCT_NAME>'s Bluetooth range. _Your collar will now be able to connect to your phone via Bluetooth from <NUMBER> farther than before._

**What does extended Bluetooth range mean for you?** 

* You will be able to receive real-time collar updates on <UI_ELEMENT> from <NUMBER> farther than before – even if there is no internet connection.
* During hikes and walks, instant feedback will be more reliable because it's being sent instead over Bluetooth instead of over the Internet.

This firmware update will work for all phones and all <PRODUCT_NAME> models. It will not impact your collar's battery life.

## **Updating Your Collar's Firmware**

When a firmware update is available, your collar will automatically download the update when it is connected to WiFi or cellular and is [charging](<URL>). [Click here for full instructions on updating your collar's firmware.](<URL>)

To check what firmware version your collar is currently running:

1. Open your <APP_NAME> and navigate to **<UI_ELEMENT> > <UI_ELEMENT>**
2. Select the collar for which you want to check the firmware version and scroll down to the “**<UI_ELEMENT>**” section
3. Here, the App will tell you what version of firmware your collar is currently running (i.e. “**Current version <NUMBER>**”) and if there are any updated versions available for download (i.e. “**Version <NUMBER> is available**”).

If the App says “**<UI_ELEMENT>**,” then your collar is currently running the latest version of the firmware.

_Please note that your_ _collar will continue to work properly even if it isn’t running the most up-to-date version of the firmware_. However, you should apply firmware updates at your earliest convenience."
"## Environment

* Product_A
* Training

## Answer

With hearing-impaired dogs - you can utilize the Product_A's haptic and vibration feedback. Many dogs have successfully responded to these types of sensations, learning to recognize and acknowledge them as cues for behavior adjustment. This method is especially useful for hearing-impaired dogs who can't rely on auditory signals.

Here are some tips to add visual cues to your training:

**Visual Cues**: Use markers to create clear, visible boundaries. Combined with the device's feedback, this helps your dog understand and reinforce boundary limits.

**Consistency**: Markers provide uniform boundaries, aiding faster and more effective learning.

**Transition**: Gradually remove markers once boundaries are understood, relying on device feedback.

**Confidence**: Clear boundaries reduce confusion and boost your dog's confidence.

**Ease for Trainer**: Markers guide you in consistently enforcing boundaries.

By integrating visual cues with the device's feedback, you can effectively train your dog to understand and respect boundaries.

## Answer

There are two types of wireless fences you can easily create for your pet. The first is a Boundary Fence, which is created based upon specific geographic constraints that you wish to enforce. Typically, this type of fence may be placed around your property. All you need is the Software_B installed on your phone and a Product_A in your hand. 

While holding the device, walk to each location where you would like to add a fence post and tap the **Add GPS** button in the Software_B. 

The second type of fence is one in which the exact location of the boundary is not as important, such as when you take your pet to the beach, the park, or to a friend's house. This type of fence can be drawn directly in the Software_B without ever leaving where you're standing. 

There are a few important guidelines to follow when creating your fence. Keep your boundary at least [Number] [Unit] away from any hazards or other areas you want your pet to avoid. Also, keep boundaries at least [Number] [Unit] from your house and any other high structures that may interfere with the GPS signal. When including your home within a fence, make sure your **entire** home is within the fence and at least [Number] [Unit] from the boundary line outside. Most importantly, please refer to the complete instructions available in the Software_B for all the details and how to create each type of fence.

"## Environment

* Training

## Answer

While we do not provide or sell flags at this time, if you do decide to use flags to establish a boundary while training your dog with the collar can be very helpful for several reasons:

**Visual Cue for the Dog**  
1) Flags provide a clear, visual boundary that helps your dog understand where the limits are. This is especially useful during the initial stages of training.  
2) When combined with the feedback from the collar (such as sounds, vibrations, or static correction), the visual cue of the flags helps reinforce the idea of boundaries in your dog's mind.

  
**Consistent Boundary Marking**  
1) Flags create a consistent and uniform boundary, which is crucial for effective training. Your dog learns to recognize and respect the same boundary lines repeatedly.  
2) Consistency in training helps dogs learn faster and more effectively. By using flags, you ensure that the boundaries are clear and unchanging.

  
**Transition to Invisible Boundaries**  
1) Once your dog understands the boundaries with the help of flags, you can gradually remove the flags. Your dog will then rely on the feedback from the collar to understand the boundaries.  
2) This gradual transition helps in solidifying the training. Your dog will eventually learn to stay within the boundaries even without the visual aid of flags, relying solely on the collar's feedback.

  
**Increased Confidence for the Dog**  
1) Dogs thrive on knowing what is expected of them. Flags help set clear boundaries, reducing confusion and increasing your dog's confidence during training.  
2) When your dog respects the boundaries marked by the flags and receives positive reinforcement (treats, praise), it strengthens the desired behavior.

  
**Ease for the Trainer**  
1) Flags act as a guide for you as well, making it easier to teach and reinforce boundary training.  
2) They provide a clear reference point, ensuring that the trainer can consistently enforce the boundaries without ambiguity.

  
**Summary**  
Using flags to establish a boundary while training with the collar enhances the learning process by providing clear visual cues, ensuring consistency, aiding in the transition to invisible boundaries, increasing the dog's confidence, and assisting the trainer. This method results in a more effective and efficient training experience for both your dog and yourself."
"## Environment

* Product_A
* App_A

## Answer

Yes, it is possible to create Location_A fences over a body of water like a lake or ocean. However, it is important to note that the water can have an effect on the GPS signal and feedback that the collar provides. This is because water can absorb and reflect radio waves, which can interfere with the GPS signal.

* Additionally, if the collar gets submerged, the water can interfere the feedback and cause it to be less reliable.

Here are some tips for creating Location_A fences over water:

* Avoid placing fence posts directly in the water. Instead, place them on the shore or on a dock.
* Test the fence regularly to make sure that your pet is receiving the correct feedback.

**If your pet's collar gets wet, be sure to dry it completely before plugging it back in.** 

### **Water Resistance**

The Product_A has been through significant testing—including submersion, swim testing, and salt water testing. It has an IP67 water rating and can be safely submerged in water up to Number_A feet (Number_B meters) deep. That means that at the surface where your pet will be swimming, it will be totally water-resistant!

## Additional Notes

* Here is an article that explains [how to create a Location_A fence!](URL_A)

If you have any further questions and would like to speak to our live support team, please feel free to reach out using the following article: [How to Contact Customer Support](URL_B) and we'll be happy to help!"
"Yes, you can use ProductA even if your home (or any other building you frequent) has a metal roof although it can affect the collar satellite reception more than a non-metal roof.

If you are inside of your home or any building with a metal roof, the ProductA will detect that it is indoors, which will put it in ""low GPS"" mode, pausing navigation and fence preventions. This is normal and expected performance for the ProductA. When your dog leaves the house/building and goes outside, ProductA’s GPS receiver will quickly switch to ""Strong GPS"" mode and resume navigation and fence preventions.

It helps if the collar picks up low-level satellite signals when indoors though to help with its general accuracy when going back outside. If you notice in the [GPS signal settings](URL) that the collar is consistently showing signals under 100 when indoors and off of your dog/on the charger, then it may help to move the collar to a different location. Try placing it next to a window or an exterior facing wall or door."
"**Objective**

* Download and apply a firmware update to your Device using WiFi/cellular and your charger

**Environment**

* Device
* Charger

**Procedure**

The Device's firmware (the software that operates the device) will automatically update if the device is connected to WiFi or cellular and is [charging](/hc/en-us/articles/360041129254). You may notice the firmware version appears '**Out of Date**' on the device list in the App when a new firmware version has been released. There are two steps to the updating process:

1. Downloading the software - when your device is out of date, this happens automatically as necessary while the device is connected to WiFi/cellular and charging. The App will send you downloads when the download begins. You will not know this is happening and may continue using the device as normal. If you do use the device in the middle of a download, the process will automatically pause until the next time it is plugged in and on WiFi.
2. Installing the software - this happens automatically upon completion of the download. **During the automated install process, the Device battery light will blink Red for as few as 30 seconds and up to 10 minutes.** It is recommended that you do not unplug the device from charging while this is happening. This is the only reason you will see the Device blink red while on the charger.

Once both of these steps are complete, the battery indicator on the Device will resume blinking green or go to solid green (depending on if it is still charging or fully charged), indicating the upgrade is complete. You will also receive a notification via the App, and the firmware status will display ""**Up to Date**"" on the device list in your App. 

**Additional Notes**

* While the update can download over cellular, Wifi is preferred. Wifi allows for other downloads to occur automatically that would not happen when only connected to cellular.
* If you are having trouble updating your device using the above method, then you can [follow these instructions to perform a wired firmware update.](LINK)

* Halo Collar

## Answer

Once your dog completes the training, they'll know the meaning of the Fence Feedback notifications and won't leave their Halo Fence boundary. 

In the event that a dog ignores the Feedback, our Halo Fence is not like a 'regular' fence, which doesn't offer any protection once you move beyond it. With Halo, your dog will receive Emergency Feedback when it crosses the fence boundary _while moving away from the safe zone_. This is not a one-off event; the dog will continue to receive Emergency Feedback if it continues to move away from the safe zone. 

As soon as your dog stops moving or turns around and starts heading back to safety, the Emergency Feedback will cease, and the collar will begin to offer Encouragement Feedback (specifically, the configurable Return Whistle) to call them back to their safe zone. 

**Protection Zone**

There is a Protection Zone that extends about [Number] feet ([Number] meters) beyond the boundary of your Halo Fence. _Your dog will continue to receive Emergency Feedback as long as it is continuing to move away from safety and still within the Protection Zone._

If the dog moves beyond the outer limit of the Protection Zone, the Halo Collar will enter 'Lost Mode'. Once in Lost Mode, the collar will no longer give your dog Emergency Feedback, so as not to confuse your dog further. Instead, it will direct your dog back to the safety of your Halo Fence using the Return Whistle. These encouraging prompts will continue until your dog is safely within the confines of your Halo Fence once again. 

**Note:** You can view your dog's location using the My Map feature of the App. The collar will provide location updates as long as your phone is connected to the Internet and your dog's Halo is connected to the Internet via cellular ([Company Name]), Wi-Fi, or has a Bluetooth connection to your phone. You will be notified via the Halo App when your dog receives its first Emergency Feedback when leaving the Halo Fence.
